How do you do. I'm Katze Mildnana. Are you the one who pranced with me earlier? Color me salmon pink, I'm thrilled to be in your life! I find sausage links make me sneeze.
Why hello there! I'm Tadita Meansir. What's your favourite hobby? Mine is pole dancing. I can't get enough of it. I'm thinking of writing a cookbook for different kinds of mayonnaise. Don't pull my tail. Unless I ask.
Good day. My name is Midnight Dillifu. Let's cut to the chase: I like practicing radical self care. Wanna join? Everything I own is cottoncandy, even my litterbox! I also grow ghost peppers in my garden.
Hi-ya, my name is Muca Sadpip, but you can call me whatever you like *wink*. I always thought I'd be a great Cosmonaut, except I'm not tantalizing enough. Wanna hold hands?
Shalom. Gen 0 is the name, dissecting live mice is the game. I'm really trying to make it as a FBI Agent. Spending my nights catching leprechauns probably isn't helping, though. I'm going to show you the time of your life.
Greetings. Please call me Coocoo Lubsmookie or else I may scratch. I like trying to swallow ribbons at the lunar new year. Can you handle me?
Salutations! I'm Catastrophe Scootchhickey, and you're cute. If you can guarantee our relationship will be flammable, we're good here. Don't cross me and we'll be just fine.
Hi, I'm PU21. And you are? I can safely say that hummus is the greatest thing since sliced bread. Don't even try to convince me otherwise. I was voted "most changed since freshman year", but I always thought I should have won "best dresser".
How you doin. I'm Tora Khanmuffin. I enjoy long saunters across your countertop and grooming myself on your pillow. What do you prefer to eat when standing on your human's head? I like meatloaf. I know many interesting facts about the rare and majestic rabbit.
I see you! I'm Countess Zappyzap, get it right. At night, I like to put dragonfruit paint all over my body and press up against buildings. I call it "making paint angels". Does anyone even use Angelfire anymore?
RAWR XD! I'm Angel Sourwall, pleased to meet you. I'm really into collecting marmalade right now. Can you buy me some catnip? I'll get you back, I promise.
Hey! Ho! Let's go. I'm Floyd Abraroo, but you can call me whatever you'd like. If you look closely into my eyes, you'll see hints of my lineage as a shapeshifter. I want to know what love is. I want you to show me.
Hi-ya. I'm Nisse Ministersocks. I'm trying to live my best life, inheriting millions and disrupting industries. I was voted "Most victorious" at my office Christmas party. Can I have your watch?
Salutations. I'm Kira Dootukhus. I am currently trying to start my own company making corsets for tripod kitties. Can you tell me if my fur pattern makes my ankle look big? I used to be a Professional Sleeper until I hurt my calf.
Namaste. My parents named me breeder. I have no idea why. My squad always tells me to be more silly, but meh. Smell ya later!
Namaste. My name is breeder, and my game is practicing archery. My parents fed me peanut butter when I was a kid and I refuse to eat it now. If you ever want to try fad dieting just hit me up.
Ugh. Yaya Abrabun is the name, tipping glasses of water over is the game. Can you tell me if my fur pattern makes my knuckles look big? Let's pump some Luke Bryan and get busy!
How you doin, I'm breeder, but what's in a name, anyway? My best feature? My eyelid, obviously. I'm a kitty, you're a human, this friendship is our destiny.
Oh heyyy. My name is Sam Daintybobo. My favourite topic of conversation is Napoleon Bonaparte. In another life, I think I would have been a crocodile. Can you buy me some catnip? I'll get you back, I promise.

I must be the luckiest kitten in the world!

Eyyyyyyy. Marbles Kingfrou? Haven't heard that name in years. I'm trying this weird diet where I only eat oranges, I'll let you know how it goes. Sometimes, when I'm cutting my own bangs, I stop and think, isn't it crazy that the Illuminati run the banks.

Howdy. I excel at kickboxing. Oh, right, my name is Savannah. I'm really into collecting ghost pepper hot sauce right now. I can't believe you'd show your face around here.
Hallo. I'm Karima Fancynose, and my name is my name. Whenever I heard Lil Yachty it makes me think of cucumbers. Check me out!

Oh hi. I'm Azizi Sillytitch. I'm turbulent and diaphanous, and sometimes even inconsiderate. I completely forgot my Napster login and that makes me angry! Someday, all of this will be yours.
RAWR XD. I'm Martha, but you can refer to me as your new best friend. To be honest, stealing mints is all I'm really interested in. Alright, alright, alright.

Hi. I'm Sugar Yankeenic, and you're cute. I'm really trying to make it as a Storm Chaser. Spending my nights picking flowers probably isn't helping, though. In high school I was voted "most likely to cure the common cold" and it definitely came true.

Hello human, my name is Norangi Goosebip, but I'll also respond to Lady Gaga. I normally wear pencil skirts so it's awkward that you've caught me wearing nothing but a fur coat. Stay on your side of the bed and we'll manage just fine.
Ohayou! My name is Dieter Wonkydoo, and my game is swiping right. Cat Power wants me, but I'm more of a The Beatles fan. Do you also love marmite?

Welcome! I'm Gizmo Olestud. I tickled Joy Division when I was younger, but those days are gone. My college voted me "most likely to become a meme", but I was always more interested in licking frozen poles. I'm a kitty, you're a human, this friendship is our destiny.

Ni hao. I'm Madam Bluntboo, at least that's what they're calling me these days. I feel bad for those poor fools who don't believe the moon landing was produced by Steven Spielberg. I can't believe you'd show your face around here.

Hey, what's up, hello. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Chayim Elfinwidgey and I am very well known for drinking natural wines and glaring at the neighbour's cat. I combine the strength of the dog with the grace of the gecko. I'm single and ready to mingle.
Oh hi. My parents named me Count Amazebean, but I prefer Mother Teresa. Let's spend the whole day listening to Backstreet Boys together. I used to be a Back-End Developer / Personal Trainer until I hurt my tummy.
Oh heyyy. I'm Young Fineeyes. I already like you. Want to go shopping? We can get our claws painted. I don't have time for new friends, but I'll make an exception for you.
Yikes! You scared me. I'm Maow Waltzlink. Pleased to meet you. Whenever I eat horseradish my pee turns Pantone 18-3838 ultra violet. Is that normal? Let's pump some Pavarotti and get busy!
I see you, please refer to me as Lulu Flirtypip, and only that. I'm trying this weird diet where I only eat salad, I'll let you know how it goes. Goodnight.
Ciao. They call me Captain Megasmoosh. Hey, got any chocolate on you? I'm always hungry. If you look closely into my eyes, you'll see hints of my lineage as a gremlin. Hold my beer.

Oh hi. I'm Myeong Carrum. I'm working on a scientific experiment involving the belly and the heart of a newly discovered type of demigod. That's all I can tell you for now. I'm really trying to make it as a Spin Instructor. Spending my nights cooking up a storm probably isn't helping, though. Ta-ta for now.
How you doin. I excel at playing the tuba. Oh, right, my name is Rara Liondeedee. In another life, I think I would have been a sloth. Your secret is safe with me.

Howdy, I'm Precious Meanfluff, but what's in a name, anyway? If you look closely into my eyes, you'll see hints of my lineage as a centaur. What do you get when you combine Jane Austen with a wild rooster? I'm genuinely asking.

Top of the mornin' to ya. My parents named me Kira Waltzfu. I have no idea why. I once entered a litter-eating contest just for a bag of Doritos. I did not win. Whenever I hear Liberace I just have to swat.

Good morning, please refer to me as Mumu Dooeyes, and only that. Some people think I look like Jeff Goldblum, what do you think? Can you handle me?
Heyo! My real name is unspeakable in the human language, so you can call me Doctor Lubtukhus. I once flummoxed King Henry VIII for a bucket of shrimp. I try to bury that memory deep in the litterbox of my mind. I was the runt of the litter, but trust me, I'm thriving.

Hi friend! I'm Smokey Scrummygirl. I tend to grimace when I'm excited. I'm trying to consume at least one serving of sausage links every day. It's a newer health thing I read about on the web. Want to play Pac-Man together? I'm addicted.

How's it going. I respond to Muschi Ughpop, although that doesn't mean I'll acknowledge you. I was going to become a Brain Surgeon, but then I found out watermelon seeds will grow in your stomach. Sometimes, when I'm reinventing myself, I stop and think, isn't it crazy that trolls live in nearby caves and come out at night to sing by the light of the moon.

Allo. I'm called Nisse Goosecadabra. I've wandered this planet in search of a dragon, but so far, all I have found is lasagna. I normally wear knee-high socks so it's awkward that you've caught me wearing nothing but a fur coat. Can you handle me?
Noice. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Senator Snagglewall and I am very well known for crafting puns and singing in the shower. Do you think I could pass as a dumbo octopus if I tried to sneak into a zoo? Later, I'm headed to play Mega Man.

Hi friend. I respond to Trilly Daintypop, although that doesn't mean I'll acknowledge you. I often wonder what a lovechild between Bob Saget and Abraham Lincoln would look like. I'm craving a garlic and ghost pepper hot sauce right now, is that weird?

I'm Kottur Gunkfield, who's asking? I like applying for credit at the lunar new year. One time I beat Milo in an arm wrestle.
Rise and grind. I like shakin' dat booty because my name is Akemi Bluntfuzzle. Would you believe me if I told you Tupac and the others are living on a remote island? What if I said milk was invented by the government as a way to subdue the cat population? Also, I love McDonalds happy meals.
Ooope. I'm called Momo Pingsir. I like long walks on the beach and Tapatío. Believe it or not, spying on the neighbours is seriously exhilarating. You should try it some time. Did we just become best friends?
How's it going. I'm Nina Twinkleears, herald of the otherworld. I still dream of becoming a Veterinarian, but I'm not sure where to start. Fly, you fool.
What's up, my name is Tora Skookumtukhus, but I prefer to go by Blackbeard. I can whistle any Tom Jones song. It's a weird talent, but it entertains most people. Ta-ta for now.

Halloooo! I'm Demon Emomoo. I'm pretty sure I'm part gecko, I hope that doesn't bother you. At night, I like to put emerald green paint all over my body and press up against buildings. I call it "making paint angels". Welp, seeya later.

Noice. My name is Mr. Yo Kungfutummy, but I'm in the process of legally changing it to Jeff Goldblum. I've never actually finished Sixteen Candles, I get too distracted with cutting my own bangs. I was the runt of the litter, but trust me, I'm thriving.
Hark! I'm Pudding Whippop//Pu04. I think I would have been voted "most likely to become a meme" if I had stayed in school. I'm craving a chocolate ding dong and ranch dressing right now, is that weird?
How you doin. Señor Demonnano is the name, siring for status is the game. In my spare time I like to make socks. My celebrity crush is Shia LaBeouf.

Greetings. My name is Thor Bippitysmoochie, but I'm in the process of legally changing it to Diane Keaton. If I could be anybody in the world, it would be Starscream. I like the way you smell.
Hi. I seem to have lost my name tag, but I'm Suki Fiddledeenano. All I want in life is to listen to my Mac Demarco CDs in peace. Is that too much to ask? People think it's weird, but t-rex is my favourite delicacy. Try it with mango chutney, you'll see what I'm saying.
I'm Moses Souldub, how the hell are ya!? Beneath this tough exterior beats the heart of a wild yeti crab. Later, I'm headed to play Eve Online.

Hey cutie. I'm Boots Ughzinga. Have we met? I'm terrible with names. Can you tell me if my fur pattern makes my paws look big? Ever since I met Ryan Reynolds I've believed the world is surrounded by an ice wall that stops us from falling into space.
Hai. My real name is unspeakable in the human language, so you can call me Ginger Ahemlili. Did you know my parents are aliens? I know, crazy right? I've been mistaken for Hobbes because I'm so good at siring for status. Fancy Cats are cool, but I'm more interested in breeding for love.

Good day. You may call me old & new. My squad always tells me to be more ambidextrous, but meh. Call my agent if you need me for anything outside of breeding.
Welcome. My parents named me Catsup Bluemoo. I have no idea why. Believe it or not, sleeping in fresh laundry is seriously exhilarating. You should try it some time. I'm craving a filet of fish and mango chutney right now, is that weird?
Sup playa, I'm Biscuit Sprinkletime, but what's in a name, anyway? I think me and Cleopatra would get along just fine. My mother might not approve of you, but that only makes me want to spend time with you even more.

忙啥呢！! 认识我的人都管我叫 Manscape Elfinmust！若你也喜欢茶酱面，那我们就有话可聊啦！ 我吃任何食物都要放腐乳汁 ，真的。比如三明治、 披萨、 意大利通心粉— 任何食物。 愿我俩的友谊一代又一代地传下去！
Howdy. My name is Missus Tallsmoochie, and before you ask, no, it's not short for anything. Everything I own is mint green, even my litterbox! I love listening to Lauryn Hill's latest release while cooking chocolate.
Halloooo. Call me Chairman Greywidgey. Don't call me Sal. I'm descended from Chester Cheetah. My mother might not approve of you, but that only makes me want to spend time with you even more.
Hello darkness, my old friend. I'm Minou Flabheart. I like long walks around my litter box. Whenever I eat salt water taffy my pee turns cerulean. Is that normal? I see those eyes you're giving me. *wink*
Howdy. You may call me Amorita Twinklenoice. I shall call you King Louis XIV. I normally wear kid gloves so it's awkward that you've caught me wearing nothing but a fur coat. Want to play Angry Birds together? I'm addicted.

Boo! I'm Micio Cattyrubin, get it right. I went to school with Pink Panther, back then that was one heartwarming cat. Don't pull my tail. Unless I ask.
Noice. My name is Gaga Sporksir. I love to wear black. I once got stung by a bee on my kidney. People think it's weird, but t-rex is my favourite delicacy. Try it with McChicken sauce, you'll see what I'm saying.
*hissing noises*. My parents named me Tadita Zippyshins just to ban all dogs from chasing balls, just to see the look on their faces. I feel bad for those poor fools who don't believe wrestling matches are rigged. Don't ever leave me. I don't like being alone.
Heya. I am Young Tallzip. I'm glad you've come. Me and Jonah Hill don't talk anymore. This concludes our business dealings.
How you doin. I'm Chicco Warytail. I feel like I know you from a past life... I'm trying to consume at least one serving of cantaloupe every day. It's a newer health thing I read about on the web. What do you want from me?
Who goes there. I'm Amiga Fabmuffin, and I will be your personal Penguin Charmer. I'm really trying to be more exuberant right now. Do you think it's working? Until our next encounter...

Noice. I'm SE 16 alt. What's your favourite hobby? Mine is people-watching. I can't get enough of it. I feel bad for those poor fools who don't believe snake people run the world. Fancy Cats are cool, but I'm more interested in breeding for love.

Heyo. Folks call me Minka Wonkybop. No one actually knows my real name, they just know how erudite I am. To be honest, shooting clay pigeons is all I'm really interested in. Fancy Cats are cool, but I'm more interested in breeding for love.

Yaya! My name is Zizi Kungfufu. Let's get to know each other better. All I want in life is to listen to my Queen CDs in peace. Is that too much to ask? I'm reading your aura, and it's sky blue.

Top of the mornin' to ya. My name is Big Queenmumu, and before you ask, no, it's not short for anything. I heard a rumour Michael Cera was running for president. They'd have my vote. Ta-ta for now.
*tips hat*. I'm Misty Didgeribow, and you're cute. I still dream of becoming a Dairy Farmer, but I'm not sure where to start. I eat in my sleep, I hope that's not going to be a problem.
Hey, what's up, hello! I'm Bao Sprinkletruck. I enjoy long saunters across your countertop and grooming myself on your pillow. Me and Emma Watson don't talk anymore. Will you brush my tail? I like it brushed three times a day.
Shalom! My name is Boots Alltruck. I'm rambunctious, you're bashful, let's connect. Ever think it's weird that you never see Alexander the Great and Michael J Fox in the same place at the same time? Let's get matching George Costanza tattoos.

Behold, it is I, Old Grimskiboop. Some people think I look like Larry David, what do you think? Did we just become best friends?
Bonjour! I'm Koshka Muggoo, your littermate for life. I'm the biggest fan of Justin Bieber because I always put wasabi on my eggplant. Weird, right?
How goes it. Folks call me Azizi Delidrop. No one actually knows my real name, they just know how funky I am. I'm the biggest fan of Justin Timberlake because I always put stevia on my ice cream. My only policy is no politics.
Shalom, my name is Tocho Wasabiness, but I'll also respond to Gwen Stefani. My favourite way to vacation is watching Netflix and only consuming chocolate-covered pretzels. Don't even think about it.
Hey! Ho! Let's go. I'm Heffe Lionwidgey. I feel like I know you from a past life... Whenever I heard Mos Def it makes me think of macadamia nuts. I once curved a hobbit, it was glorious.
Hola! I'm Buttercup Sporkbobo, your littermate for life. I went to school with Gary the Snail, back then that was one lovable cat. I can't talk here, there are too many eavesdroppers around.

Heyo. I'm Fabiano Crazyniption. I beheld Michael Bolton when I was younger, but those days are gone. I like prank-calling celebrities at the lunar new year. Sometimes, when I'm grooming myself, I stop and think, isn't it crazy that the first person to walk on Mars will turn red.
Halloooo. My name is Hime Cartail, what's yours? I spend most nights trying to find out where Diane Keaton lives. I once tried to stalk Emma Watson. It did not end well for me.

Hello. I'm Gizmo Vilebum, student of Balthazaar of the Unknown Lands. I'm really trying to make it as a Mad Scientist. Spending my nights breaking into aquariums probably isn't helping, though. Will you take me skinnydipping? But first, can you tell me what that is?
*waves*, I'm Kottur Scootchwidgey, but what's in a name, anyway? Did you know Scream 3 is really about this lizard that gets covered in marmite? It's in the subtext. Will you brush my tail? I like it brushed three times a day.

Well look who it is, I'm Mister Dullbutt, but what's in a name, anyway? My best feature? My nostril, obviously. I also grow ghost peppers in my garden.
Allo. I'm Countess Sulkymuffin. Are you the one who embarassed me earlier? My parents fed me relish when I was a kid and I refuse to eat it now. I can't imagine being with any other breeder now that I've met you!
Heya. My name is Nick Sunnybuncle, and before you ask, no, it's not short for anything. To be honest, getting the people going is all I'm really interested in. Call my agent if you need me for anything outside of breeding.

Sup. I am the one and only Colonel Twinklebaloo. At night, I like to put salmon paint all over my body and press up against buildings. I call it "making paint angels". Weird, right?
Yarr matey. I excel at fighting for the people. Oh, right, my name is Maow Gobzip. I'm thinking of writing a cookbook for different kinds of maple syrup. Does anyone even use Myspace anymore?
Mahalo. They call me Heffe Zippybuncle. Hey, got any flaming tacos on you? I'm always hungry. Pink Floyd wants me, but I'm more of a The Jonas Brothers fan. Let's go to my litter box, it's where I conduct all my meetings.

Hiya. I respond to Precious Stoicwump, although that doesn't mean I'll acknowledge you. I'm trying to consume at least one serving of oatmeal every day. It's a newer health thing I read about on the web. You and I go together like cereal and relish.

Hola. I'm Floozy Yankeerumpus. Do you also love to eat trash with peanut butter? My magician name is Bob Saget the turbulent. Also, I love McDonalds happy meals.
Hola, I am Captain Sadtruck, devoted friend of the alpaca. I once interned for Che Guevara. It was... interesting. Vote for me in your next local election! *wink*
I am 1.6 DW SE03R12, who dares approach me? Oh, it's you. My parents fed me low fat mayo when I was a kid and I refuse to eat it now. Goodnight.
Oy. My name is Lieutenant Sullendeedee, which got me teased a lot in high school. I've never actually finished Dr. Strangelove, I get too distracted with staring into space. Would you believe that Ryan Gosling is just like you and me?
Heya. My real name is unspeakable in the human language, so you can call me Missus Mildfuzzle. If you can guarantee our relationship will be infuriating, we're good here. Will you brush my tail? I like it brushed three times a day.
哈啰！. 大家都称我为 Andrew Dullkazam！我是一名农夫，下班后我最喜欢自拍加美图。 我最喜欢在坐公共汽车的时候大吃 汉堡 。 希望我俩可以成为最喵伙伴！
How's kicks. My name is Floyd Lionbuncle, but I've always believed I'm Andrew Jackson reincarnated. I want our friendship to be like the one between Legolas and the Yellow Ranger. Get ready to lie in the sun and do nothing all day with me.
雷猴！. 请叫本喵 Andrew Waltzwump！我只愿意和与我有共识的人生活在一起，我们都相信汪星人其实是被派来占领地球的外星机器人 。 本喵经常被人说荒诞，事实也确实如此。 让我们把尾巴编在一起永不分离！
I'm Dreggo, and I'm all fired up and feeling pretty fangtastic about the future. It's dark and boring in here, to be honest with you, and I'm egg-cited to get out soon. World, here I come!

Who goes there. I'm Bacio Sunnybip, captain of the S.S. Litterdeck. All I want in life is to listen to my Miley Cyrus CDs in peace. Is that too much to ask? I'd flex for you, but I don't want to ruin my yoga pants.
What gives. I'm 2/5 PEP SE03. I can tell we're going to have a good time together. If you can guarantee our relationship will be stinky, we're good here. Let's go shopping at the organic foods market on Sundays.

Hallo. I'm Duke Allpants, and I need to be honest with you. Can you scratch my fingernails? I'm too lazy to do it myself. If you can prove if you wish on a falling star it will come to life and marry you then I'll eat my denim leggings right here, right now.

Hi-ya, my name is Becky Harris, but you may address me as supreme cat overlord. Did you know The Titanic is really about this lizard that gets covered in cocktail sauce? It's in the subtext. I heard Ryan Gosling has a crush on me. Meh.

*hissing noises*. I'm Sparky Magicswoggle. I was once a barista at a cat café. My band's sound is a mix of French Montana and Aretha Franklin. I often get mistaken for Dropkick Murphys.

G'day! You may call me Cookie Hulawump. If I had to describe you in one word, it would be gregarious. You asked! I still dream of becoming a Train Conductor, but I'm not sure where to start. Goodnight.
I see you. I'm Missus Sassyluv. I'm gorgeous and demure, and sometimes even hip. Some call me freaky, others call me chaotic, but really, the best description for me is cuddly. I was the runt of the litter, but trust me, I'm thriving.
Hello human. I'm Catnip Hulalump. Let's cut to the chase. Let's spend the whole day listening to Chet Baker together. Can you explain where babies come from? Asking for a friend...

How's it going! My name is Professor Bevynutter. I work as a Deep Sea Explorer, and I also moonlight as a Saruman impersonator. To be honest, spinning yarns is all I'm really interested in. Until our next encounter...
吃了没！。我喜欢叫自己 Bao Purrpookie，除此之外，我什么名字都不喜欢！我承认我有点 深情 ，但我还是很懂得享受美好时光。 每周二本喵会和一群喵同道合的伙伴见面，喝着牛奶讨论 猪真的会飞，只是他们硬要装作不会。 相信我，你将会日久见喵心。
Hey cutie. I'm Maow Bevybop. Do you also love to eat deep fried butter with blue cheese dressing? I want our friendship to be like the one between Mike The Situation and Eric Cartman. Well, I'll be.
Greetings, tiny humans! I am Draco, first of my name, lighter of fires and getter of it started in here. Do not drag on too long in conversation, for you are crunchy and taste good with hot sauce. Just kidding, I don't eat people — my favourite snack is firecrackers.
Hi, I'm Sensei Shyshorts. And you are? I was once roommates with a surly witch. It was sensible. Can I pitch you my start up? It's going to disrupt the Paranormal Investigator industry.

Yo. I'm Sensei Awesomemust. I feel like I know you from a past life... My squad always tells me to be more smelly, but meh. My only policy is no politics.
*tips hat*. My parents named me Mumu Whipway, but I prefer Che Guevara. Did you know that Ash Ketchum used to slather their spicy salami in McChicken sauce? My New Year's resolution is to be more courageous.
I am Felis Wonderpop, who dares approach me? Oh, it's you. I would go on a date with a transformer owl just to be a jerk. You're going to need a lot of wine for this relationship to be tolerable.
Oy. I seem to have lost my name tag, but I'm Kaka Waddlefield. I was once roommates with a surly zombie. It was exquisite. I often get mistaken for Mobb Deep.
Yowza. My name is Nero Sourdeedee 3. As a young kitten, I was always bathing in the sunlight, but I think I've grown out of that. At night, I like to put oldlace paint all over my body and press up against buildings. I call it "making paint angels". I can't believe you'd show your face around here.
Good day, I'm Catnip Gobsire. What?! You don't remember me? I'm trying this weird diet where I only eat enchiladas, I'll let you know how it goes. I heard Michael Cera has a crush on me. Meh.

Welcome. I'm Felis Ministerfuzzle, and I'm not here to make friends, I'm here to win. I stopped eating filet of fish because I heard the Illuminati control the world, but cats control the Illuminati. Can you handle me?

Ni hao. I'm Suki Muggirl. I'm brilliant, you're smelly, let's connect. To be honest, picking flowers is all I'm really interested in. What do you get when you combine Genghis Khan with a wild dumbo octopus? I'm genuinely asking.
Oh hi. My name is Maow Finenose, but I'm in the process of legally changing it to Jonah Hill. My college voted me "most likely to repeat high school", but I was always more interested in prank-calling celebrities. If you ever want to try taking selfies just hit me up.

Hello human, my name is se03, but I'll also respond to Luke Bryan. I normally wear t-shirts so it's awkward that you've caught me wearing nothing but a fur coat. Rude.
*waves*. My name is Minu Pingsir, but I'm in the process of legally changing it to Jonah Hill. I really want to zigzag a nice aye-aye one day, is that weird? Ever since I met Shia LaBeouf I've believed the election was rigged.
Salaam. I'm SE 03/ Bandit Dingbinky. Let's cut to the chase. What do you prefer to eat when standing on your human's head? I like macadamia nuts. I can't imagine being with any other breeder now that I've met you!
What gives. I'm Lencho Kungfufrou. I am currently trying to start my own company making snowpants for tripod kitties. Some call me spicy, others call me hyper, but really, the best description for me is garish. What do you want from me?
Good morning. I'm Missus Grimmpuss. Do you want to watch me getting the people going? I sure hope so. Catnip, wine, and chocolate are all I need to be happy. I find chorizo sausage make me sneeze.

Hey! Ho! Let's go, I'm Mittens Vilefield. Pleasure's all mine. I was once roommates with a surly zombie. It was adventurous. I want to know what love is. I want you to show me.
Check it! Allow me to introduce myself. I am Marshall Yappywump and I am very well known for unravelling toilet paper and grooming myself. My best dress-up costume ever was when I impersonated George Costanza. Please pay attention to me.
Hey, what's up, hello. I seem to have lost my name tag, but I'm Zizi Didgericutie. I often get mistaken for Calvin Harris. Can you help me get past the part in Smash Bros that I can't beat?
Aloha, I'm 2.5/5. Pleasure's all mine. If you can guarantee our relationship will be provocative, we're good here. Smell ya later!
Hello darkness, my old friend. I'm Jax Sadsnuggums, pleased to meet you. I often wonder what a lovechild between Rose McGowan and Joan of Arc would look like. Would you believe that Larry David is just like you and me?
Boo. I'm Chayim Mugtitch, and I'm as cute as it gets. Just ask my mom! I'm convinced I'm the reincarnation of Mahatma Gandhi but I hit my nose when I was a kitten so who knows. I find garlic make me sneeze.

RAWR XD! I'm Cookie Fluffybobo. I bumped into Kanye when I was younger, but those days are gone. I would go on a date with a platypus just because someone double-dog dared it. Awkwaaaaaaaard.
Shalom. My name is Kali Sulkytruck, which got me teased a lot in high school. You should know that I'm obsessed with catching the world's first gorgon, and I won't rest until I do. I'd flex for you, but I don't want to ruin my ankle socks.
Prrawr! I'm Draco Junior, and someday they will sing the tale of my great and terrible fire! Right meow, though, I'm mostly sticking to marshmallows... but they get totally toasty! If you don't want to get toasted to a purrfect golden brown, you'd better leave my cave now!

Halloooo. I like aligning my energies because my name is Mother Meanfizzle. Did you know Starship Troopers is really about this moose that gets covered in low fat mayo? It's in the subtext. Our auras seem aligned. I'm pawsitive this was meant to be.
G'day. I'm TheOne. Do you want to watch me watching Jerry Springer? I sure hope so. When I was a kitten I was convinced I was actually a secret vampire. That turned out to be false. I'm single and ready to mingle.

Hello. Maow Spicygwai is the name and picking daisies is the game. I'm convinced I'm the reincarnation of Thomas Edison but I hit my tummy when I was a kitten so who knows. What's up? Cat got your tongue?
*hissing noises*. I'm 4.5/5, at least that's what they're calling me these days. I did the album artwork for the latest Shania Twain album. I'm pretty proud of it. Would you believe that Jeff Goldblum is just like you and me?
Yaya. I seem to have lost my name tag, but I'm Mister Demonface. I'm trying this weird diet where I only eat horseradish, I'll let you know how it goes. Holla at me.
Sup. My parents named me Tzar Sassyfield. I have no idea why. I spend most nights trying to find out where Jeff Goldblum lives. Talk to the paw.
Oy. I went by the name Yaya Lionmoo once. I often get mistaken for Beethoven. Also, I love McDonalds happy meals.

Hey cutie. My name is Captain Woolink. I pretty much only listen to Counting Crows. During my kitten days, I debated Phil Dunphy. I once tried to stalk Ryan Reynolds. It did not end well for me.
Yaya, my name is Sensei Bopway, but I prefer to go by Winston Churchill. When I'm embarassed, I get sweaty in my calf area. Your secret is safe with me.
Good day. I'm Nisse Bluntcaw. No cat puns, please. I've dedicated my nine lives to preserving threatened zombie habitats. Whenever I hear Childish Gambino I just have to conspire.
How goes it! My name is 3.5 h1 SE03 + martian, but I prefer to be addressed as "your highness". I heard a rumour Diane Keaton was running for president. They'd have my vote. I'd flex for you, but I don't want to ruin my stockings.
Yo. I went by the name Koshka Greentime once. I assess you to be lovable, and I approve. What's that smell?
Top of the mornin' to ya. I am Sergeant Canwump, AKA Kitty of your dreams. My hobbies include playing Bonbon Smash, but only in moderation. Fancy Cats are cool, but I'm more interested in breeding for love.
Greetings, tiny humans! I am Stacked, first of my name, lighter of fires and getter of it started in here. Do not drag on too long in conversation, for you are crunchy and taste good with hot sauce. Just kidding, I don't eat people — my favourite snack is firecrackers.
I see you. I'm Kottur Hissguts. It's true, I love wet food. I really want to sulk a nice rhino one day, is that weird? People think it's weird, but goose is my favourite delicacy. Try it with seven bean dip, you'll see what I'm saying.
How do you do. I'm Zaki Megagoo. I come from a land far, far away. I normally wear clutches so it's awkward that you've caught me wearing nothing but a fur coat. À Bientôt!
Jambo. I'm Norangi Spicyplum. What's your favourite hobby? Mine is licking frozen poles. I can't get enough of it. When I'm embarassed, I get sweaty in my tongue area. Whenever I hear Liberace I just have to preen.

Heyo. My name is 4.3/5, but I'm in the process of legally changing it to Jonah Hill. I was once roommates with a surly medusa. It was gorgeous. My only policy is no politics.

Hey, what's up, hello. My parents named me 3.3/5 just to be the sole decision maker for one episode of Dancing with the Stars. If you can guarantee our relationship will be preposterous, we're good here. Don't even think about it.

Good day! I'm Doodoo Souleyes, but you can call me whatever you'd like. I'm a big fan of The Backstreet Boys. Vote for me in your next local election! *wink*
Halloooo. My name is Daiki Lackapip, and my game is practicing witchcraft. I'm convinced I'm the reincarnation of Eva Peron but I hit my eyes when I was a kitten so who knows. Can you buy me some catnip? I'll get you back, I promise.
Mahalo. I excel at catching leprechauns. Oh, right, my name is Fabiano Tanpants. Would you believe me if I told you the upside down really does exist? What if I said catnip is a government conspiracy? Nobody puts Kitty in a corner!
Welcome! I'm President Sleepysimmons, and I'm as cute as it gets. Just ask my mom! I've been asked to join Dropkick Murphys, but I'm more of a Cher fan. Goodnight.
Boo! I'm called Shadow Hulacaw. I like long walks on the beach and maple syrup. I'm trying to consume at least one serving of meatloaf every day. It's a newer health thing I read about on the web. I often get mistaken for Joni Mitchell.
*deadpan stare*. I'm Benny Goodpants! I enjoy long walks and coughing up furballs. I often get mistaken for The Strokes. I can't talk here, there are too many eavesdroppers around.
How do you do! I'm Chibi Magictot. I tend to sulk when I'm excited. I spend all my money on Justin Bieber records and I don't even have a record player yet. Can you handle me?
Ni hao. I'm Chubby Egobean. Please take a seat. My best feature? My hind legs, obviously. K bye.
En Taro Adun! I'm Krumel Dingkins. I flirted with 50 Cent when I was younger, but those days are gone. I like licking frozen poles at the lunar new year. Goodnight, I'm going to sleep.
Hi, I'm Susi Bevyrubin. And you are? I'm the biggest fan of Chumbawamba because I always put guacamole on my corn dogs. Welp, seeya later.
How's it going, I'm Duke Bobolink. What?! You don't remember me? I once slid into Ryan Reynolds's DMs. Leave me.
Namaste. My name is Lala Abrazinga, which got me teased a lot in high school. I was once roommates with a surly basilisk. It was egotistical. Let's braid our tails!
Enchanté. I'm 0.5 Lynx Verdi SE03R1R2, feline warrior of a magical realm I can't tell you about. I've never actually finished Starship Troopers, I get too distracted with reading Voltaire. I look like a cat, but I actually belong to the crocodile family.
Bonjour! I'm Yaya Wonkyhickey. I tend to wince when I'm excited. Color me mauveover, I'm thrilled to be in your life! Ta-ta for now.
Oh heyyy, my name is Doctor Dawgshmoops, but I'll also respond to Erykah Badu. When I was a kitten I was convinced I was actually a secret gorgon. That turned out to be false. Don't @ me.
I'm Kiisu Demonsire, how the hell are ya!? I'm really trying to be more spicy right now. Do you think it's working? Hip hip hooray!
Ohayo. I'm Shoshannah Magnificentboo, and I will do almost anything because someone dared me. I can safely say that salsa is the greatest thing since sliced bread. Don't even try to convince me otherwise. I'm single and ready to mingle.
Ohayo. My name is Benny Conwump. I pretty much only listen to Coldplay. My best dress-up costume ever was when I impersonated Zapp Brannigan. Word on the street is Red Dead Redemption 2 is the best game of all time. All time!

Listen up, my name is Muschi Lackatooth, but you may address me as supreme cat overlord. If you look closely into my eyes, you'll see hints of my lineage as a dragon. My only policy is no politics.
*yawn* Sorry, you caught me napping. I respond to Chubby Stoicfizzle, although that doesn't mean I'll acknowledge you. Me and Sandra Bullock don't talk anymore. Let's go invest in a condo together.
Ooope. My name is Myeong Bippitykins. I love to wear hintomint. I'm a cat, but I've always felt more like I belong in the emu family. Word on the street is Duck Hunter is the best game of all time. All time!
Ohayou, I am Captain Catfield, devoted friend of the rooster. Ever think it's weird that you never see Ash Ketchum and Rose McGowan in the same place at the same time? I'll get started on our friendship bracelets.
Prrawr! I'm Draco Junior, and someday they will sing the tale of my great and terrible fire! Right meow, though, I'm mostly sticking to marshmallows... but they get totally toasty! If you don't want to get toasted to a purrfect golden brown, you'd better leave my cave now!
Hello human. My name is Boots Sadgirl. I'm hip, you're garish, let's connect. If you'll just give me 30 seconds of your time, I can prove beyond a doubt that the world is flat. Let's braid our tails!
Oh heyyy. I am Señor Proudobie and I am better at sweating through my feet than you. Try me. I'm one of the few kitties that can eat chocolate-covered pretzels using only my nose. Will you help me with my resumé?
What gives. You may call me Mosi Emodub. My squad always tells me to be more lovable, but meh. Let's watch Rick and Morty together.
Hiya! I'm 3/5, get it right. In my spare time I like to make clutches. Can you help me get past the part in Duck Hunter that I can't beat?
Oh heyyy! I'm Mister Demonrue. I dare you to say my name three times in front of a mirror! Can you scratch my hamstrings? I'm too lazy to do it myself. I was the runt of the litter, but trust me, I'm thriving.
噢嗨喵！. 在下名为 Ari Ughcaw！我曾经把毛球吐到 乾隆皇帝 的喵主子身上，老实说，他们可是自找的，哼！ 每周二本喵会和一群喵同道合的伙伴见面，喝着牛奶讨论 哈利波特的魔法世界是全世界的最高机密，但它确实存在。 让我们一起培养更优秀的喵后代吧！

What gives. I'm Dieter 4x2.5=0.2, collector of marbles and breaker of hearts. I like to collect snowpants. If you're nice enough, maybe I'll give you one. People think it's weird, but grizzly bear is my favourite delicacy. Try it with bbq marinade, you'll see what I'm saying.
Top o' the muffin to ya. I'm Lieutenant Sadflop. Do you want to watch me conjecturing wildly? I sure hope so. I was once roommates with a surly elf. It was hairy. Want to start a band together? Dibs bass!
I'm Noodles Pharoahtush, who's asking? Have you ever seen a cat with a cyan buttocks? I've spent the last few years perfecting my chocolate recipe. Wanna try it?
I'm Dreggo #2830, and I'm all fired up and feeling pretty fangtastic about the future. It's dark and boring in here, to be honest with you, and I'm egg-cited to get out soon. World, here I come!
Hey! Ho! Let's go. I'm Inama Whiprum, and I will be your personal Culinary Sanitation Specialist. I'm convinced I'm the reincarnation of Mary Queen of Scots but I hit my abdomen when I was a kitten so who knows. I find spicy salami make me sneeze.

How do you do! I'm pa 2, at least that's what they're calling me these days. When I was a kitten I was convinced I was actually a secret shapeshifter. That turned out to be false. Let's pump some Hanson and get busy!

Mahalo! I'm known as Floyd Sprinklenic. I have a complicated past, but I'm ready for a new beginning. I'm a big fan of Paula Abdul. What's up? Cat got your tongue?
Who goes there. Chris Bubblesloo is the name, watching reality TV is the game. Believe it or not, pretending I don't see humans is seriously exhilarating. You should try it some time. Sometimes, when I'm climbing trees, I stop and think, isn't it crazy that the red dot poses significant danger.
Greetings, tiny humans! I am Draco, first of my name, lighter of fires and getter of it started in here. Do not drag on too long in conversation, for you are crunchy and taste good with hot sauce. Just kidding, I don't eat people — my favourite snack is firecrackers.

Hi, I'm Fuku Snookyfu. And you are? At night, I like to put harbourfog paint all over my body and press up against buildings. I call it "making paint angels". My New Year's resolution is to be more zany.
*bows*! I'm Azizi Snagglebip. I dare you to say my name three times in front of a mirror! If you look closely into my eyes, you'll see hints of my lineage as a liger. Check me out!
Hallo. I'm Duke Allpants, and I need to be honest with you. Can you scratch my fingernails? I'm too lazy to do it myself. If you can prove if you wish on a falling star it will come to life and marry you then I'll eat my denim leggings right here, right now.
Behold, it is I, Popo Lackarue. I combine the strength of the mouse with the grace of the grizzly bear. You're going to need a lot of wine for this relationship to be tolerable.
*waves*. I'm Chibi Warydoo. I am currently trying to start my own company making ponchos for tripod kitties. Do you think I could pass as a koala bear if I tried to sneak into a zoo? If you can prove the election was rigged then I'll eat my swimsuits right here, right now.
Hi, I'm Yoyo Greybest. And you are? I heard a rumour Jonah Hill was running for president. They'd have my vote. Don't even think about it.
Hi-ya, my name is Becky Harris, but you may address me as supreme cat overlord. Did you know The Titanic is really about this lizard that gets covered in cocktail sauce? It's in the subtext. I heard Ryan Gosling has a crush on me. Meh.
Yowza. My name is Heffe Friendwampus. I'm an expert in collecting stamps, so let me know if you're interested in trying it out. I was voted "Most perfunctory" at my office Christmas party. Don't ever leave me. I don't like being alone.
Yo yo yo. I'm Cookie Poopzap, student of Balthazaar of the Unknown Lands. I'm convinced I'm the reincarnation of King Henry VIII but I hit my earlobe when I was a kitten so who knows. Call my agent if you need me for anything outside of breeding.
Ohayo. I'm Cheeky Snookycadabra. Do you want to watch me mocking hipsters? I sure hope so. I once entered a litter-eating contest just to ban anyone from wearing tights as pants. I did not win. I love playing The Sims. Wanna join me?
Salutations! I'm Cecil  Sprinkleshins, feline warrior of a magical realm I can't tell you about. I've dedicated my nine lives to preserving threatened troll habitats. Does anyone even use Limewire anymore?
Guten tag. My name is Chayim Kingeyes, and before you ask, no, it's not short for anything. Let's spend the whole day listening to Childish Gambino together. Come, I'll show you my collection of hollandaise.
Hello. I'm Doctor Conpooka! I enjoy long walks and coughing up furballs. You should know that I'm obsessed with catching the world's first zombie, and I won't rest until I do. I look like a cat, but I actually belong to the platypus family.
I'm Dreggo, and I'm all fired up and feeling pretty fangtastic about the future. It's dark and boring in here, to be honest with you, and I'm egg-cited to get out soon. World, here I come!
先生女士们！.  我的名字是 Max Tallloo！我曾经为 鹿晗 伴舞，直到有一次被别人发现我其实一直在模仿比格沃斯先生的舞步。 如果家里空无一人，本喵就会呼喵唤友，一起欣赏 张艺兴的美妙音乐。 本喵等不及到了凌晨四点叫你起床上厕所了！

Noice. I'm Daiki Bippitygah. I'm pretty sure I'm part t-rex, I hope that doesn't bother you. Did you know if you sneeze with your eyes open they'll pop out? I know, crazy right? I've been mistaken for Thomas O'Malley The Alley Cat because I'm so good at creating ice sculptures. You're going to need a lot of wine for this relationship to be tolerable.
Prrawr! I'm Draco Junior, and someday they will sing the tale of my great and terrible fire! Right meow, though, I'm mostly sticking to marshmallows... but they get totally toasty! If you don't want to get toasted to a purrfect golden brown, you'd better leave my cave now!

Oh, hello! My real name is unspeakable in the human language, so you can call me Countess Greysire. My favourite way to vacation is watching Netflix and only consuming sausage links. Can you explain where babies come from? Asking for a friend...
Yaya. I'm Cecil  Twinklesmoosh, fairy princess of Cottoncandyland. I'm a cat, but I've always felt more like I belong in the dog family. My New Year's resolution is to be more infuriating.

Oy, I'm Maow Sunnyzap. Pleasure's all mine. My best dress-up costume ever was when I impersonated Frodo Baggins. Hold my beer.
Hey cutie, I'm Taters Crazywall. What?! You don't remember me? I heard a rumour Emma Watson was running for president. They'd have my vote. Pffft, whatever.
Yo. I'm Ashes Zappytot. I'm trying to live my best life, cooking up a storm and clawing up furniture. I went to school with Tonto, back then that was one exquisite cat. Let's get matching Kim Pine tattoos.
Good morning. My name is Mister Gunkpookie, which got me teased a lot in high school. I like to collect smoking jacket. If you're nice enough, maybe I'll give you one. You're going to need a lot of wine for this relationship to be tolerable.

Guten tag. I'm Tocho Dillititch, and I will do almost anything to own a Tesla. I've dedicated my nine lives to preserving threatened unicorn habitats. If you ever want to try drinking natural wines just hit me up.
Oy. I'm Kira Egogah. Are you the one who swindled me earlier? All I want in life is to listen to my Pavarotti CDs in peace. Is that too much to ask? I like the way you smell.

Halloooo. I am Farfalle Hulaloo, AKA Kitty of your dreams. Would you believe me if I told you rappers write their own rhymes? What if I said the world is surrounded by an ice wall that stops us from falling into space? I'm like Blake Shelton, but more suggestive.

Yo. I'm Sensei Awesomemust. I feel like I know you from a past life... My squad always tells me to be more smelly, but meh. My only policy is no politics.
*tips hat*. My parents named me Mumu Whipway, but I prefer Che Guevara. Did you know that Ash Ketchum used to slather their spicy salami in McChicken sauce? My New Year's resolution is to be more courageous.
I am Felis Wonderpop, who dares approach me? Oh, it's you. I would go on a date with a transformer owl just to be a jerk. You're going to need a lot of wine for this relationship to be tolerable.
Oy. I seem to have lost my name tag, but I'm Kaka Waddlefield. I was once roommates with a surly zombie. It was exquisite. I often get mistaken for Mobb Deep.
Yowza. My name is Nero Sourdeedee 3. As a young kitten, I was always bathing in the sunlight, but I think I've grown out of that. At night, I like to put oldlace paint all over my body and press up against buildings. I call it "making paint angels". I can't believe you'd show your face around here.
Good day, I'm Catnip Gobsire. What?! You don't remember me? I'm trying this weird diet where I only eat enchiladas, I'll let you know how it goes. I heard Michael Cera has a crush on me. Meh.
Listen up! I'm Panda Hotpet, at least that's what they're calling me these days. I once interned for Charlemagne. It was... interesting. I'm a kitty, you're a human, this friendship is our destiny.
G'day. I'm Catsup Crazytime. Do you also love to eat corn dogs with cinnamon? If you can guarantee our relationship will be funky, we're good here. I'm single and ready to mingle.
Hello, I'm Trilly Goosegirl. Pleasure's all mine. I like personal development at the lunar new year. Let's go solving sudoku together!
Halloooo! Allow me to introduce myself. I am Mister Groggoo and I am very well known for educating people on being a nevernude and rearranging price tags at the supermarket. I went to school with Chester Cheetah, back then that was one annoying cat. Later, I'm headed to play Hearthstone.
Welcome. I'm Felis Ministerfuzzle, and I'm not here to make friends, I'm here to win. I stopped eating filet of fish because I heard the Illuminati control the world, but cats control the Illuminati. Can you handle me?
Ooope! I'm known as Micio Dullheart. I have a complicated past, but I'm ready for a new beginning. On Sundays I like swiping right. Please do not disturb me then. What's that smell?
哟，吓我一跳！. 请叫本喵 4,5/5 H1 pepper！我只愿意和与我有共识的人生活在一起，我们都相信汪星人其实是被派来占领地球的外星机器人 。 本喵的曾曾曾曾曾曾曾曾喵祖母曾今追随 岳飞。 让我俩一起领悟喵真理吧！
Oh heyyy. I respond to pep+mart+se03+dragon(r1)+to(r1, although that doesn't mean I'll acknowledge you. I always thought I'd be a great Street Magician, except I'm not lovable enough. This conversation is over.
Greetings, tiny humans! I am Draco, first of my name, lighter of fires and getter of it started in here. Do not drag on too long in conversation, for you are crunchy and taste good with hot sauce. Just kidding, I don't eat people — my favourite snack is firecrackers.
*tips hat*! My name is 3.5/5, but I prefer to be addressed as "your highness". My band's sound is a mix of Mobb Deep and Queen. I want to be the ultimate fighting champion.
Hello. I'm Kotka Whipsire. I already like you. I'm really trying to become a master Illusionist. Spending my nights chasing double rainbows probably isn't helping, though. I'll get started on our friendship bracelets.
干啥呢！。我喜欢叫自己 4/5 H1 Martian，除此之外，我什么名字都不喜欢！我承认我有点 勇敢 ，但我还是很懂得享受美好时光。 有些人说我在团体里有蜘蛛侠 的个性。 本喵希望你也和我一样喜欢可爱喵星宝宝。
*deadpan stare*. Ashes Bobotruck? Haven't heard that name in years. I'm trying this weird diet where I only eat raisins, I'll let you know how it goes. GET OUT OF MY ROOM!
I'm Dreggo, and I'm all fired up and feeling pretty fangtastic about the future. It's dark and boring in here, to be honest with you, and I'm egg-cited to get out soon. World, here I come!
Uh, hi. My name is Mittens Sizzlelili, and before you ask, no, it's not short for anything. My new life goal is to catch a elf on the shelf and make it share its powers with me. Get ready to lie in the sun and do nothing all day with me.
Hi. I'm Maow Elfintock 4.5. Do you also love to eat ahi tuna with Tapatío? I think me and Benjamin Franklin would get along just fine. I want to know what love is. I want you to show me.
What gives! I'm Booboo Bubblesnana, but you already know that. In my spare time I like to make hand-made jewelry. Come, I'll show you my collection of marmalade.
Greetings. I'm Sergeant Wonderdub, captain of the S.S. Litterdeck. Catnip, wine, and deep fried butter are all I need to be happy. Will you brush my tail? I like it brushed three times a day.

Eyyyyyyy, I'm Sixten Sourears, but what's in a name, anyway? I'm thinking of writing a cookbook for different kinds of thousand island dressing. Someday, all of this will be yours.
*winces*. I'm Priya Bufffizzle. I can tell we're going to have a good time together. Color me onyx, I'm thrilled to be in your life! Ever since I met Jonah Hill I've believed rappers write their own rhymes.
Hello. My name is 4/5 Chubby Jankymuffin. I love to wear rainbow. I like playing chess at the lunar new year. What do you say you and me get outta here?
Ni hao. I'm Suki Muggirl. I'm brilliant, you're smelly, let's connect. To be honest, picking flowers is all I'm really interested in. What do you get when you combine Genghis Khan with a wild dumbo octopus? I'm genuinely asking.
Oh hi. My name is Maow Finenose, but I'm in the process of legally changing it to Jonah Hill. My college voted me "most likely to repeat high school", but I was always more interested in prank-calling celebrities. If you ever want to try taking selfies just hit me up.
Yikes! You scared me. I like casting spells because my name is Misty Sleepydeedee. Did you know Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is really about this dolphin that gets covered in mango chutney? It's in the subtext. Call my agent if you need me for anything outside of breeding.
Yo yo yo. I went by the name Great Leonopteryx once. I often get mistaken for Rihanna. I don't have time for new friends, but I'll make an exception for you.
RAWR XD! I'm Booboo Mactime. I'm trying to live my best life, practicing yoga and baking catnip edibles. What do you prefer to eat when standing on your human's head? I like peanuts. Later, I'm headed to play Frogger.

Behold, it is I, Karima Whipgee. I stopped eating chocolate ding dong because I heard the reason we never find dead Bigfoots is because aliens take their bodies away. I can tell you like to get into trouble.

Greetings, tiny humans! I am Draco, first of my name, lighter of fires and getter of it started in here. Do not drag on too long in conversation, for you are crunchy and taste good with hot sauce. Just kidding, I don't eat people — my favourite snack is firecrackers.
Good day. I'm Goya Taterbip, but you can call me whatever you'd like. I spend most nights trying to find out where Jonah Hill lives. Awkwaaaaaaaard.
Yo yo yo. I'm Mimi Sprinkledub. I feel like I know you from a past life... Whenever I heard Mac Demarco it makes me think of whiskies. Want to play Super Meat Boy together? I'm addicted.
Uh, hi. I'm Catnip Cootsimmons. Are you the one who embarassed me earlier? I did the album artwork for the latest Michael Bolton album. I'm pretty proud of it. I love playing The Sims. Wanna join me?
RAWR XD! I'm Cookie Fluffybobo. I bumped into Kanye when I was younger, but those days are gone. I would go on a date with a platypus just because someone double-dog dared it. Awkwaaaaaaaard.
Shalom. My name is Kali Sulkytruck, which got me teased a lot in high school. You should know that I'm obsessed with catching the world's first gorgon, and I won't rest until I do. I'd flex for you, but I don't want to ruin my ankle socks.
Prrawr! I'm Draco Junior, and someday they will sing the tale of my great and terrible fire! Right meow, though, I'm mostly sticking to marshmallows... but they get totally toasty! If you don't want to get toasted to a purrfect golden brown, you'd better leave my cave now!
Sup! I'm Precious Kinkymoo. Pleased to meet you. Color me taupe, I'm thrilled to be in your life! I'm reading your aura, and it's bananacream.
Hark! I'm Katu Dawgway. I still dream of becoming a Balloon Captain, but I'm not sure where to start. Does anyone even use AOL anymore?

Hallo. I'm Briciola Sprinklerumpus. I'm hungry. I'm trying to consume at least one serving of steak every day. It's a newer health thing I read about on the web. Weird, right?
Yaya. I'm DRACO CHOCOLATE. Please take a seat. Some people think I look like Michael Cera, what do you think? People think it's weird, but goat is my favourite delicacy. Try it with mango chutney, you'll see what I'm saying.
*tips hat*. I'm Moses Yappycadabra. I tend to sashay when I'm excited. I always thought I'd be a great Paw Model, except I'm not preposterous enough. Come, I'll show you my collection of squeeze cheese.
Halloooo. I like aligning my energies because my name is Mother Meanfizzle. Did you know Starship Troopers is really about this moose that gets covered in low fat mayo? It's in the subtext. Our auras seem aligned. I'm pawsitive this was meant to be.
G'day. I'm TheOne. Do you want to watch me watching Jerry Springer? I sure hope so. When I was a kitten I was convinced I was actually a secret vampire. That turned out to be false. I'm single and ready to mingle.
Uh, hi. My name is H1 martian, but I've always believed I'm Ash Ketchum reincarnated. I think I would have been voted "best beard" if I had stayed in school. You're fancy, and I like it.
Sup playa. I'm pa 2, at least that's what they're calling me these days. I once slid into Jeff Goldblum's DMs. You and I go together like raisins and ghost pepper hot sauce.
Noice. I'm Buttercup Sunnyfizzle. I am currently trying to start my own company making short shorts for tripod kitties. I taught Katy Perry everything they know about composing poems. Pffft, whatever.
Heya, I am Loki Sassyknees, devoted friend of the moose. Some people think I look like Jonah Hill, what do you think? Let's go invest in a condo together.
Meow! I'm Taters Scrummybear! I enjoy long walks and coughing up furballs. I'm well-educated, don't worry. Also, I love McDonalds happy meals.

Shalom. I'm Mimi Sizzlekip. Let's cut to the chase. I'm a cat, but I've always felt more like I belong in the octopus family. My mother might not approve of you, but that only makes me want to spend time with you even more.
*deadpan stare*, my name is Manscape Meankey, but I'll also respond to Blink 182. Catnip, wine, and mac 'n' cheese are all I need to be happy. My solar plexus is itchy and I can't reach. Would you mind?

Ohayou. I'm Old Yappystud bA, but you already know that. I once slid into Emma Watson's DMs. What's that smell?
Hi. I'm Chubby Demondrop, but you can refer to me as your new best friend. Would you believe me if I told you I can fly, I can touch the sky? What if I said JFK made it out alive? Well, I'll be.

What's up. I'm Big Sizzlemust. Step into my office. My college voted me "school jock", but I was always more interested in running a podcast. Peace out!
Welcome. I'm Shadow Scuttlepuss, get it right. Did you know that John F. Kennedy Jr used to slather their lasagna in kimchi? K bye.

I'm nomyparoasis 2.5X2 Dreggo, and I'm all fired up and feeling pretty fangtastic about the future. It's dark and boring in here, to be honest with you, and I'm egg-cited to get out soon. World, here I come!
Aloha! I'm Mimi Bluntright, student of Balthazaar of the Unknown Lands. I can safely say that ghost pepper hot sauce is the greatest thing since sliced bread. Don't even try to convince me otherwise. Hold my beer.
Ohayou, my name is 3.3/5, but I'll also respond to Spice Girls. If I want to put mayonnaise all over my deep fried butter, I shouldn't have to answer to anyone about it, am I right? This conversation is over.
Heyo. My name is 4.3/5, but I'm in the process of legally changing it to Jonah Hill. I was once roommates with a surly medusa. It was gorgeous. My only policy is no politics.
Good day. Taters Sillydork? Haven't heard that name in years. Whenever I eat chorizo sausage my pee turns cyan. Is that normal? If you can prove watermelon seeds will grow in your stomach then I'll eat my socks right here, right now.
Welcome. I'm Popo Ughsniggle. Have we met? I'm terrible with names. If I could be anybody in the world, it would be Gretchen Wieners. Alright, alright, alright.
Hello. I'm Ashes Sprinklefluff. Let's cut to the chase. I combine the strength of the dik-dik with the grace of the gecko. Awkwaaaaaaaard.
Bonjour. I'm Daniela Fiddledeekazam. I dare you to say my name three times in front of a mirror! I was once roommates with a surly sasquatch. It was erudite. This concludes our business dealings.
Namaste! My name is Lencho Whipman. My favourite topic of conversation is Joan of Arc. I can safely say that pickles is the greatest thing since sliced bread. Don't even try to convince me otherwise. What's that smell?
Enchanté. I'm 4/5, but you can call me whatever you'd like. My best feature? My clavicle, obviously. Let's braid our tails!
Hola. I'm Cecil  Sporkfluff. I enjoy long saunters across your countertop and grooming myself on your pillow. Whenever I heard Father John Misty it makes me think of sardines. Hip hip hooray!
How's kicks! I'm Kiisu Lionpip. I tend to gallop when I'm excited. My squad always tells me to be more ebullient, but meh. In high school I was voted "class clown" and it definitely came true.
Yarr matey. My name is Moses Zappykip, which got me teased a lot in high school. I spend most nights trying to find out where Michael J Fox lives. I like the way you smell.

Greetings, tiny humans! I am Draco, first of my name, lighter of fires and getter of it started in here. Do not drag on too long in conversation, for you are crunchy and taste good with hot sauce. Just kidding, I don't eat people — my favourite snack is firecrackers.
I'm 8437~3qqq~a7gp~4mmm, who's asking? Unlike most cats, I always land on my eyebrow. I can't imagine being with any other breeder now that I've met you!
Uh, hi. You may call me Count Grimskidrop. I've been asked to join Johnny Cash, but I'm more of a Joy Division fan. Later, I'm headed to play Mega Man.
How do you do, my name is Moses Purrnutter 3,5/4 ver-, but I prefer to go by Napoleon Bonaparte. If you'll just give me 30 seconds of your time, I can prove beyond a doubt that once you go tabby, you never go back. Wanna hold hands?
Yo yo yo. I'm called Tora Emomuffin. I like long walks on the beach and garlic butter. I really want to authenticate a nice octopus one day, is that weird? Your secret is safe with me.
Yowza! I'm Peaches Dullface, collector of marbles and breaker of hearts. I honestly would rather do anything else besides watch Dante's Peak. I also grow ghost peppers in my garden.
吃了没！. 在下名为 Kira Biliness！我曾经把毛球吐到 卫青 的喵主子身上，老实说，他们可是自找的，哼！ 本喵吃任何食物都要放点 草莓果酱 。就像热狗、肉夹馍— 任何可以吃的里都要，真的。 本喵可考虑收你为徒。
Who goes there. I am Bao Whipgah, AKA Kitty of your dreams. What do you prefer to eat when standing on your human's head? I like meatloaf. Don't pull my tail. Unless I ask.
Mahalo. I'm Guile Achoosniggle, and I will be your personal Paranormal Investigator. All I want in life is to listen to my Grimes CDs in peace. Is that too much to ask? Will you take me skinnydipping? But first, can you tell me what that is?
Noice, I'm Chubby Buffwampus. Wait! No, let me start again. I completely forgot my Kazaa login and that makes me angry! Our auras seem aligned. I'm pawsitive this was meant to be.
*bows*. I'm Zuzu Kinkycadabra. Let's cut to the chase. In my spare time I like to make turtlenecks. My mother might not approve of you, but that only makes me want to spend time with you even more.
Listen up. I'm Mack Yankeeboop. I feel like I know you from a past life... Did you know that Abraham Lincoln used to slather their vegan burgers in garlic butter? Alright, alright, alright.
Ohayo! You may call me Mister Ahemobie. If I had to describe you in one word, it would be alarming. You asked! Whenever I eat bananas my pee turns mint green. Is that normal? Well, I'll be.
Halloooo, I'm David Bahsimmons. I hope we don't start off on the wrong paw. Sometimes, when I'm winning hearts and minds, I can't help but think about the brisk centaur. Let's pump some The Beatles and get busy!

Noice! I'm Bacio Tickdrop, and I'm not here to make friends, I'm here to win. I assess you to be lovely, and I approve. Alright, alright, alright.
Yo! The name's Goya Snaggleheart. On Sundays I like riverdancing. Please do not disturb me then. I'm like Beethoven, but more exquisite.
Sup playa! Allow me to introduce myself. I am Fabio Sprinklehands and I am very well known for stalking crows and collecting stamps. I once batted my paw at Mary Queen of Scots to own a Tesla. I try to bury that memory deep in the litterbox of my mind. Meowza.

Ugh. I'm Fabiano Waddlekewtie, feline warrior of a magical realm I can't tell you about. I still dream of becoming a Professional Cuddler, but I'm not sure where to start. Nobody puts Kitty in a corner!
Namaste. I excel at chasing string. Oh, right, my name is Midnight Meanzinga. I spend all my money on Migos records and I don't even have a record player yet. What's up? Cat got your tongue?
Behold, it is I, Peaches Khanrubin. I've never actually finished Pitch Perfect, I get too distracted with reinventing myself. You're fancy, and I like it.
Hey, what's up, hello. I'm Loki Bipshmoops. I'm working on a scientific experiment involving the hamstrings and the heart of a newly discovered type of gremlin. That's all I can tell you for now. Want to go shopping? We can get our claws painted. I eat in my sleep, I hope that's not going to be a problem.
Salutations. You can call me Peanut Finelili. My best friends are a panda and a platypus. This one time, at band camp, I was voted "life of the party". Let's go weaving in and out of humans' legs together!

Ciao. I'm called 3/ SE 03,03/Amiga Zippymoo. I like long walks on the beach and pâté. I'd give anything to hang out with Michael Cera. People think it's weird, but patagonian mara is my favourite delicacy. Try it with cocktail sauce, you'll see what I'm saying.
Greetings, my name is Kocka Fluffytukhus, but you may address me as supreme cat overlord. I always thought I'd be a great Cat Burglar, except I'm not suggestive enough. Rude.
Yaya! I'm Missus Bluntbear, fairy princess of Cottoncandyland. I combine the best qualities of John Malkovich, Benjamin Franklin, and Luke Bryan. I was the runt of the litter, but trust me, I'm thriving.

Yo yo yo. My name is Ari Melifluoustummy. As a young kitten, I was always dissecting live mice, but I think I've grown out of that. I would go on a date with a chimpanzee just because it's better to burn out than to fade away. Get ready to lie in the sun and do nothing all day with me.

Enchanté. I'm Kiisu Hornwampus. I can tell we're going to have a good time together. I feel bad for those poor fools who don't believe if you sneeze with your eyes open they'll pop out. Can I pitch you my start up? It's going to disrupt the Ghost Writer industry.
Hiya. I am 3.8/5. I'm glad you've come. I'm really into collecting mayonnaise right now. Did we just become best friends?
How do you do, I am Momo Mugtummy, devoted friend of the giraffe. I'm trying this weird diet where I only eat sardines, I'll let you know how it goes. Let's go shopping at the organic foods market on Sundays.

Boo. I like playing the tuba because my name is Captain Ughgah. Can we PLEASE watch Scream 3 together? I'm a kitty, you're a human, this friendship is our destiny.
*tips hat*. My parents named me Felis Mugkey. I have no idea why. In my spare time I like to make ski goggles. Sometimes, when I'm disrupting industries, I stop and think, isn't it crazy that this is all a dream.
*deadpan stare*. I'm Daniela Hotlump 3/5 R1Drag. Step into my office. I'm really trying to be more perfunctory right now. Do you think it's working? Awkwaaaaaaaard.

Yo. I'm Dieter Hyperzip. Are you the one who fooled around with me earlier? If you can guarantee our relationship will be fabulous, we're good here. Ever since I met Jeff Goldblum I've believed the red dot poses significant danger.
Heyo! I'm Vlad Yappyson. I'm trying to live my best life, reading Voltaire and riding unicorns. I often get mistaken for Tyler the Creator. Have you seen my push-up bras?

Listen up! My name is Duchess Sleepysire, but I prefer to be addressed as "your highness". I can whistle any Tom Jones song. It's a weird talent, but it entertains most people. Please pay attention to me.
How goes it. I'm Lord Emotitch. Roses are harbourfog, violets are scarlet, I'm weird. I think me and Picasso would get along just fine. You're going to need a lot of wine for this relationship to be tolerable.
Hi. My name is Nisse Teabah. I love to wear dragonfruit. At night, I like to put blue paint all over my body and press up against buildings. I call it "making paint angels". What's up? Cat got your tongue?
Yo yo yo. I'm called Nick Hisstukhus. I like long walks on the beach and marmite. I'm thinking of dying my fur a metallic shade of mauveover. Do you think it will suit me? Can you explain where babies come from? Asking for a friend...

Uh, hi! I'm Popo Yankeecakes, a handsome kitty just trying to make it as a Bounty Hunter. If you can guarantee our relationship will be gullible, we're good here. Vote for me in your next local election! *wink*

G'day. I'm Kit Didgericaw. It's true, I love pistachios. My squad always tells me to be more ebullient, but meh. Did we just become best friends?
Yikes! You scared me. My parents named me Grisou Prouddeedee just because someone dared me. Catnip, wine, and canned worms are all I need to be happy. What do you say you and me get outta here?
Howdy! I'm Ora Warysmookie, a dark Kitty of the night. I'm thinking of dying my fur a metallic shade of dragonfruit. Do you think it will suit me? I'm a kitty, you're a human, this friendship is our destiny.
Good morning. Captain Bevyroni? Haven't heard that name in years. Unlike most cats, I always land on my ankle. Pffft, whatever.

Hey! Ho! Let's go! I'm Andrew Doofuzzle. I enjoy long saunters across your countertop and grooming myself on your pillow. I can safely say that cinnamon is the greatest thing since sliced bread. Don't even try to convince me otherwise. Does anyone even use Neopets anymore?
Heya. I'm called Felis Surlyrumpus. I've wandered this planet in search of a robot, but so far, all I have found is oranges. I feel bad for those poor fools who don't believe the earth speaks to me through my feet. Don't cross me and we'll be just fine.
Ohayou. I am the one and only Koshka Meanboo. I once saw a fortune teller and they told me the election was rigged. Can I have your watch?
Halloooo, I am Nero Khanlink, devoted friend of the emu. During my kitten days, I haggled with Meg Griffin. Let's get matching Cheetor tattoos.

How you doin. Call me Mocha Fuzzybah. Don't call me Sal. Did you know milk was invented by the government as a way to subdue the cat population? I know, crazy right? I've been mistaken for Pink Panther because I'm so good at pawing at sleeping humans. I eat in my sleep, I hope that's not going to be a problem.

Namaste. My name is 2/5, and before you ask, no, it's not short for anything. I would honestly rather do anything else than pawing at sleeping humans. One time I beat Puss in Boots in an arm wrestle.

Oh, hello. I am Demon Snaggleshorts and I am better at bettering myself through food than you. Try me. I'm really trying to become a master Admiral. Spending my nights staying woke probably isn't helping, though. Call my agent if you need me for anything outside of breeding.
*yawn* Sorry, you caught me napping. I'm Catua Allbest, your littermate for life. I'm really trying to be more stupendous right now. Do you think it's working? Can I have your watch?

Allo! I'm Qattus Mildmoo, but you can call me whatever you'd like. Sometimes, when I'm rearranging price tags at the supermarket, I can't help but think about the egotistical oracle. I'd flex for you, but I don't want to ruin my leg warmers.
Halloooo! Call me Briciola Warmflip. Don't call me Sal. I've never actually finished 2001: A Space Odyssey, I get too distracted with sculpting my guns. Nobody puts Kitty in a corner!

How's kicks! My name is Yaya Purrkins. Let's get to know each other better. Every Tuesday evening I watch tv and binge on meatloaf. It makes the rest of the week bearable. Sometimes, when I'm collecting stamps, I stop and think, isn't it crazy that my parents are aliens.

How do you do. My name is Felis Ahemsocks. I'm magical, you're wondrous, let's connect. I listened to Tyler the Creator before it was cool. Someday, all of this will be yours.
Check it. I'm Fluffy Queenroo, and you're cute. Sometimes, when I'm playing the tuba, I can't help but think about the frivolous sphinx. I can't talk here, there are too many eavesdroppers around.
Ciao. I'm called Gizmo Waddlekewtie. I've wandered this planet in search of a zombie, but so far, all I have found is sardines. Me and Emma Watson don't talk anymore. Come, I'll show you my collection of mayonnaise.
Salutations. I'm Fifi Fiddledeedork. It's true, I love cucumber salad. Some call me provocative, others call me saucy, but really, the best description for me is stupendous. I can't talk here, there are too many eavesdroppers around.
RAWR XD. I'm Akemi Melifluousnoggin. I'm working on a scientific experiment involving the nostril and the heart of a newly discovered type of hobbit. That's all I can tell you for now. My squad always tells me to be more smelly, but meh. Does anyone even use Kazaa anymore?
Yaya. My name is Tama Joysmoosh, but I've always believed I'm Charlemagne reincarnated. At night, I like to put aquamarine paint all over my body and press up against buildings. I call it "making paint angels". This conversation is over.

Hello darkness, my old friend! I'm pa 3, your littermate for life. I want our friendship to be like the one between Rick Sanchez and George Costanza. I once flirted with a gorgon, it was glorious.
Oh heyyy. My name is Hime Bumrubin. As a young kitten, I was always licking frozen poles, but I think I've grown out of that. My college voted me "best personality", but I was always more interested in applying for credit. If you can prove once you go tabby, you never go back then I'll eat my kid gloves right here, right now.
Yaya. I'm Rara Sternson. I come from a land far, far away. I can whistle any Tom Jones song. It's a weird talent, but it entertains most people. Stay on your side of the bed and we'll manage just fine.
Greetings! I'm Lieutenant Wonkyhickey. I'm hungry. I ate salt water taffy with Tapatío on it and now my tummy hurts. I was voted "most unique", but I always thought I should have won "most likely to end up on reality tv".

Good morning. I'm Angel Widdlesir. I'm trying to live my best life, eating fine cheeses and hitting on yo' man. I taught Joni Mitchell everything they know about rearranging price tags at the supermarket. Did we just become best friends?
*winces*. You may call me Zuzu Lionmami. I shall call you Charlemagne. Beneath this tough exterior beats the heart of a wild hippopotamus. Don't cross me and we'll be just fine.
*hissing noises*. I'm Gizmo Achoorumpus. I tend to banter when I'm excited. Imagine me as Napoleon Bonaparte's more peculiar sibling. My only policy is no politics.
Greetings, tiny humans! I am Draco, first of my name, lighter of fires and getter of it started in here. Do not drag on too long in conversation, for you are crunchy and taste good with hot sauce. Just kidding, I don't eat people — my favourite snack is firecrackers.

Rise and grind. I'm Toyger. Do you want to watch me scuba diving? I sure hope so. Some people think I look like Jonah Hill, what do you think? Get ready to lie in the sun and do nothing all day with me.
Hark! I'm Brave Pharoahkewtie. During my kitten days, I played dress up with Spongebob. Hurry, we haven't much time.
Greetings, tiny humans! I am Draco, first of my name, lighter of fires and getter of it started in here. Do not drag on too long in conversation, for you are crunchy and taste good with hot sauce. Just kidding, I don't eat people — my favourite snack is firecrackers.
Hey! Ho! Let's go! I'm Madam Skookumeyes, and I'm not here to make friends, I'm here to win. I'm thinking of writing a cookbook for different kinds of marmalade. I want to know what love is. I want you to show me.
*yawn* Sorry, you caught me napping. My name is Snickers Surlyeyes, and my game is mocking dogs. All I want in life is to listen to my Joni Mitchell CDs in peace. Is that too much to ask? Let's go to my litter box, it's where I conduct all my meetings.
How you doin. I am Krishna Lilbest, AKA Kitty of your dreams. I normally wear kid gloves so it's awkward that you've caught me wearing nothing but a fur coat. Good talk, catch ya later!
What's up. Folks call me Mack Sadrum. No one actually knows my real name, they just know how rambunctious I am. Do you think I could pass as a golden retriever if I tried to sneak into a zoo? I was voted "best beard", but I always thought I should have won "life of the party".
*Wink* I'm 4.5/5. I used to love spying on the neighbours, until the accident. Let's go living the dream together!
Salaam. My name is 2.5/5. My favourite topic of conversation is Cleopatra. I once wrestled Napoleon Bonaparte for a 1967 Mercury Colony Park station wagon with hideaway lights and wood grain panel boards. I try to bury that memory deep in the litterbox of my mind. Do you also love olive tapenade?
How do you do, my name is Moses Hissmust, but you may address me as supreme cat overlord. During my kitten days, I reimbursed Mr. Weatherbee. I don't have time for new friends, but I'll make an exception for you.
Hi friend. I'm Kottur Scrummyhun. I was once a barista at a cat café. Pursuing a career in being a Master Chief has been exhausting, so I'm switching paths to be become a Test Subject. Shhhh, don't speak.
G'day, I'm 4/5. What?! You don't remember me? I did the album artwork for the latest French Montana album. I'm pretty proud of it. I can't imagine being with any other breeder now that I've met you!

RAWR XD. I'm Boots Wasabison. I'm woke and adulterous, and sometimes even infuriating. I'd say the egotistical porpoise is my spirit animal. Do you also love fancy mustard?
Eyyyyyyy, I'm Precious Kinkydrop. No, it's not pronounced Precious Kinkydrop, it's pronounced Precious Kinkydrop. I've been asked to join Dropkick Murphys, but I'm more of a The Backstreet Boys fan. Let's go sweating through my feet together!
*yawn* Sorry, you caught me napping, I'm Shushu Bevyfield. Wait! No, let me start again. When I was a kitten I was convinced I was actually a secret unicorn. That turned out to be false. Let's go to my litter box, it's where I conduct all my meetings.
What's up. You may call me Cookie Wonkynoggin. If I had to describe you in one word, it would be spicy. You asked! You should know that I'm obsessed with catching the world's first oracle, and I won't rest until I do. Word on the street is Pong is the best game of all time. All time!
Who goes there. I'm Madam Slippybip. Please take a seat. I'm well-educated, don't worry. People think it's weird, but sloth is my favourite delicacy. Try it with garlic butter, you'll see what I'm saying.
Yowza. I'm Peanut Twinklenoodle. Roses are vermillion, violets are magenta, I'm weird. I'm totally obsessed with Scratchy. Sorry, gotta jet!

Heyo. I'm Boots Bevyfield. I'm trying to live my best life, playing the tuba and crafting puns. If you ever want to try sleeping in fresh laundry just hit me up. I heard Jeff Goldblum has a crush on me. Meh.
Hello. Ooope. Allo. I'm Tama Fancypants. Can you tell me if my fur pattern makes my eyelids look big? Would you believe that Michael Cera is just like you and me?
Hi, I'm Catnip Yappyfu. And you are? I went to school with Snagglepuss, back then that was one raunchy cat. Also, I love McDonalds happy meals.
Hello. I went by the name Ruwa Vilesmookie once. Would you believe me if I told you the upside down really does exist? What if I said the world is flat? Can you handle me?

What's up. I'm Akemi Dilliears. I can tell we're going to have a good time together. I would honestly rather do anything else than talking about how much I lift. This conversation is over.
What's up. I'm Duchess Grogkins. Do you want to watch me aligning my energies? I sure hope so. I'm really trying to be more vivacious right now. Do you think it's working? My mother might not approve of you, but that only makes me want to spend time with you even more.
Salaam! I'm Muschi Lubfizzle, feline warrior of a magical realm I can't tell you about. I've dedicated my nine lives to preserving threatened wombat habitats. Can you help me get past the part in Age of Empires that I can't beat?

Top o' the muffin to ya! Allow me to introduce myself. I am Chicco Spicywight and I am very well known for slappin' da bass and discovering new plants. I'm descended from Mr. Bigglesworth. I look like a cat, but I actually belong to the rabbit family.
Allo. You may call me Loki Achooki. I'd say the courageous mouse is my spirit animal. I once reimbursed a boogeyman, it was glorious.

Ciao. Please call me 2xV 1xD 2xS LH1H2 or else I may scratch. I once saw a fortune teller and they told me the earth speaks to me through my feet. My only policy is no politics.
How do you do! I'm Yaya Dullnoodle, your littermate for life. Did you know Pluto is actually a planet? I know, crazy right? I've been mistaken for Gary the Snail because I'm so good at taunting pigeons. If you ever want to try hitting on yo' man just hit me up.
Eyyyyyyy. I'm David Amazerumpus, at least that's what they're calling me these days. If you look closely into my eyes, you'll see hints of my lineage as a witch. I'm craving a tacos and guacamole right now, is that weird?
Yarr matey! I'm Ruwa Hisslater. I like long walks around my litter box. I feel bad for those poor fools who don't believe the world is surrounded by an ice wall that stops us from falling into space. Don't pull my tail. Unless I ask.
Uh, hi! My name is Señor Viletukhus. I'm adulterous, you're frivolous, let's connect. I like taunting pigeons at the lunar new year. People think it's weird, but golden retriever is my favourite delicacy. Try it with mango chutney, you'll see what I'm saying.

Yarr matey, I am Brave Snagglezinga, devoted friend of the orca. I once debated with Mary Queen of Scots for a bucket of shrimp. I try to bury that memory deep in the litterbox of my mind. Can I pitch you my start up? It's going to disrupt the Dairy Farmer industry.
Check it. I'm called breeder. I've wandered this planet in search of a medusa, but so far, all I have found is canned worms. When I was a kitten I was convinced I was actually a secret oracle. That turned out to be false. Holla at me.
*deadpan stare*. I'm Yoko Allkazam. I'm smelly, you're fragrant, let's connect. I feel bad for those poor fools who don't believe I can fly, I can touch the sky. If you can prove the upside down really does exist then I'll eat my leg warmers right here, right now.

Well look who it is, my name is Kotka Softzap, but I prefer to go by Amelia Earhart. During my kitten days, I swindled Aragorn. I also grow ghost peppers in my garden.
Guten tag. I seem to have lost my name tag, but I'm Kotka Dingluv. I was once roommates with a surly boogeyman. It was suggestive. If you can prove the election was rigged then I'll eat my capri pants right here, right now.

I must be the luckiest kitten in the world!

I am Micio Teathang, who dares approach me? Oh, it's you. I heard a rumour Bob Saget was running for president. They'd have my vote. I can't believe you'd show your face around here.
Behold, it is I, Heffe Megadaze. I feel bad for those poor fools who don't believe this is all a dream. Don't pull my tail. Unless I ask.

Hi, I'm 3/5 h1 toyger + martian. And you are? I assess you to be brilliant, and I approve. Let's go to my litter box, it's where I conduct all my meetings.
Welcome! My name is Misty Delirubin. I work as a Mad Scientist, and I also moonlight as a Peggy Bundy impersonator. I normally wear boxer briefs so it's awkward that you've caught me wearing nothing but a fur coat. What do you say you and me get outta here?
Boo! My name is Countess Tatersir. I'm an expert in licking doorknobs, so let me know if you're interested in trying it out. I used to love spying on the neighbours, until the accident. Let's watch Rick and Morty together.
Aloha! I'm SE03 dom, herald of the otherworld. Every Tuesday evening I watch tv and binge on cereal. It makes the rest of the week bearable. If you can prove Tupac and the others are living on a remote island then I'll eat my blazers right here, right now.

Allo! My name is Demon Sadwow. I work as a Skydiving Instructor, and I also moonlight as a Vinny impersonator. I would honestly rather do anything else than talking about how much I lift. Did we just become best friends?
Yarr matey. I'm Fuku Melifluoustummy. I like long walks around my litter box. I find exploring the mysteries of the universe to be completely seductive. I like the way you smell.
*yawn* Sorry, you caught me napping. My name is Puss Tallpoppins, what's yours? Unlike most cats, I always land on my tail. Your secret is safe with me.
Hai. I'm Doctor Waltzgoo, but you already know that. I'm trying to consume at least one serving of enchiladas every day. It's a newer health thing I read about on the web. Later, I'm headed to play Pokémon Red.

Greetings, tiny humans! I am Draco, first of my name, lighter of fires and getter of it started in here. Do not drag on too long in conversation, for you are crunchy and taste good with hot sauce. Just kidding, I don't eat people — my favourite snack is firecrackers.

Hello. Jax Fiddledeedub? Haven't heard that name in years. I once got stung by a bee on my tummy. I know many interesting facts about the rare and majestic foo dog.
Yo yo yo. My name is Yaya Bahnoodle. My best friend is a boogeyman. During my kitten days, I spilled milk on Dwight Schrute. GET OUT OF MY ROOM!
I'm 312, and I'm all fired up and feeling pretty fangtastic about the future. It's dark and boring in here, to be honest with you, and I'm egg-cited to get out soon. World, here I come!
Mahalo! I'm Lala Grognoodle. I like long walks around my litter box. If you'll just give me 30 seconds of your time, I can prove beyond a doubt that alien life exists. Ta-ta for now.
Noice! I'm Catsup Warydork. I tend to banter when I'm excited. In another life, I think I would have been a platypus. Don't even think about it.
Ni hao. I'm Precious Goodhickey. Do you also love to eat oranges with marmite? I was once roommates with a surly Loch Ness monster. It was whimsical. Come, I'll show you my collection of fish sauce.
Check it. I'm Father Snookynoice. I'm working on a scientific experiment involving the tail tuft and the heart of a newly discovered type of elf. That's all I can tell you for now. I can safely say that peanut butter is the greatest thing since sliced bread. Don't even try to convince me otherwise. Gahhh, aren't you cute!
Hi! Allow me to introduce myself. I am Daiki Flirtyshmoops and I am very well known for scratching furniture and counting sheep. I like to collect brooches. If you're nice enough, maybe I'll give you one. I want to be the ultimate fighting champion.
Bonjour. I'm Nala Lionpuss. I'm pretty sure I'm part aye-aye, I hope that doesn't bother you. I'm thinking of designing an exclusive line of jean jackets. I'd love your opinion on my initial sketches! Meowza.

Check it. I'm Trixi Goodwump. Do you also love to eat wet food with vegenaise? I used to love dissecting live mice, until the accident. You're fancy, and I like it.
I see you, I'm Floozy Conmuffin. Wait! No, let me start again. Some call me headstrong, others call me health conscious, but really, the best description for me is flammable. I was the runt of the litter, but trust me, I'm thriving.
Awooooooga, my name is Benny Scootchbean, but I'll also respond to Dolly Parton. If I want to put Tapatío all over my salami, I shouldn't have to answer to anyone about it, am I right? Will you take me skinnydipping? But first, can you tell me what that is?
How's kicks! My name is Lola Sleepyguts. I'm an expert in casting spells, so let me know if you're interested in trying it out. I'm trying this weird diet where I only eat sausage links, I'll let you know how it goes. Good talk, catch ya later!

Hello human! I'm Chibi Magiclump, a dark Kitty of the night. I'm really trying to be more lawful right now. Do you think it's working? My mother might not approve of you, but that only makes me want to spend time with you even more.
Eyyyyyyy. I'm Count Bilieyes. Are you the one who sang a duet with me earlier? I spend all my money on Gwen Stefani records and I don't even have a record player yet. Shhhh, don't speak.

Jambo! I'm Tocho Crazysire, student of Balthazaar of the Unknown Lands. I have made a mixtape for a duet with Janis Joplin, but I'm having a hard time tracking them down. You can help, right? I was voted "most likely to write the next Harry Potter... by plagiarizing J. K. Rowling", but I always thought I should have won "best personality".

Yo yo yo. My name is Midnight Surlybean. As a young kitten, I was always mocking dogs, but I think I've grown out of that. Ever think it's weird that you never see Cleopatra and Michael J Fox in the same place at the same time? Get ready to lie in the sun and do nothing all day with me.
Who goes there! I'm Inama Sassycaw. I'm trying to live my best life, delivering commencement speeches and ridin' dirty. Shia LaBeouf is my spirit animal. My mother might not approve of you, but that only makes me want to spend time with you even more.

Hi! I'm Bao Greysir, a lover of all things black. I once saw a fortune teller and they told me if you wish on a falling star it will come to life and marry you. Can you buy me some catnip? I'll get you back, I promise.
How goes it. I'm Ashes Lackanoice. Do you also love to eat chocolate with peanut butter? My band's sound is a mix of Taking Back Sunday and The Artist Formerly Known As Prince. Sorry, gotta jet!
Good day. I'm Vlad Amazewow. I conducted a symphony with Vanilla Ice when I was younger, but those days are gone. Can we PLEASE watch Old School together? Good talk, catch ya later!

*Wink* I'm Priya Magnificentki. All I want in life is to listen to my The Jonas Brothers CDs in peace. Is that too much to ask? People think it's weird, but moose is my favourite delicacy. Try it with salsa, you'll see what I'm saying.
Welcome! I'm known as Inama Boopbinky. I have a complicated past, but I'm ready for a new beginning. Beneath this tough exterior beats the heart of a wild alpaca. I find chocolate ding dong make me sneeze.

Check it, my name is Peanut Hackdaze, but you can call me whatever you like *wink*. I once interned for King Henry VIII. It was... interesting. Goodnight.
Where are my manners. I seem to have lost my name tag, but I'm Popo Hulakip. When I was a kitten I was convinced I was actually a secret Ogopogo. That turned out to be false. One time I beat Simba in an arm wrestle.
Mahalo! I'm Young Sporkpuss, a handsome kitty just trying to make it as a Hypnotist. If you can guarantee our relationship will be exuberant, we're good here. Wanna hold hands?
Good day. I excel at chasing double rainbows. Oh, right, my name is Chris Softears. I once grazed thighs with Abraham Lincoln so I could win a game of Monopoly. I try to bury that memory deep in the litterbox of my mind. You're going to need a lot of wine for this relationship to be tolerable.
Hey, what's up, hello. I'm Ginger Saucybinky, you may know me from The Titanic. I once entered a litter-eating contest just because some Kitties just want to watch the world burn. I did not win. I once tried to stalk Jonah Hill. It did not end well for me.
Eyyyyyyy. Please call me Benny Grimmdeedee or else I may scratch. I've dedicated my nine lives to preserving threatened mouse habitats. In high school I was voted "most likely to kill a man just to feel alive" and it definitely came true.

Ohayo. They call me Snickers Jankylump. Hey, got any sardines on you? I'm always hungry. I'm really trying to become a master Front-end Developurr. Spending my nights modelling for calendars probably isn't helping, though. I'd flex for you, but I don't want to ruin my skate shoes.

Welcome. My name is Frank Sizzlerue. As a young kitten, I was always summoning ghosts, but I think I've grown out of that. Would you believe me if I told you the world is flat? What if I said milk was invented by the government as a way to subdue the cat population? Good talk, catch ya later!
Oy. I'm Guile Hornway, fairy princess of Cottoncandyland. I ate apple pie with cinnamon on it and now my tummy hurts. Sometimes, when I'm composing poems, I stop and think, isn't it crazy that the moon landing was produced by Steven Spielberg.

Hola, please refer to me as 3.5/5 Martian R1, and only that. I still dream of becoming a Full Time Bridesmaid, but I'm not sure where to start. I heard Bob Saget has a crush on me. Meh.
Oy. I'm Kaka Mcbutt, and I will do almost anything for an ice cream date with Beyoncé. My favourite way to vacation is watching Netflix and only consuming garlic. Does anyone even use ICQ anymore?
Good day. I went by the name Max Catnoggin once. Some people think I look like Michael Cera, what do you think? Come, I'll show you my collection of marmite.
Hallo. I'm Mother Queenmumu. I'm working on a scientific experiment involving the eyes and the heart of a newly discovered type of sphinx. That's all I can tell you for now. I would honestly rather do anything else than collecting stamps. I often get mistaken for Kanye.
Top o' the muffin to ya. My name is Peanut Mactime, what's yours? I'd say the courageous foo dog is my spirit animal. What do you want from me?
Well look who it is! The name's Commodore Fabdork. I was going to become a Cosmonaut, but then I found out milk was invented by the government as a way to subdue the cat population. Will you help me with my resumé?
*yawn* Sorry, you caught me napping. Please call me Shadow Bippitytooth or else I may scratch. Catnip, wine, and flaming tacos are all I need to be happy. I'm reading your aura, and it's scarlet.
Boo. Peanut Talllump? Haven't heard that name in years. Ever think it's weird that you never see Ash Ketchum and Emma Watson in the same place at the same time? Will you help me with my resumé?
Rise and grind! I'm Ruwa Friendman. I dare you to say my name three times in front of a mirror! My college voted me "most likely to impersonate Whitney Houston", but I was always more interested in licking frozen poles. I'm a kitty, you're a human, this friendship is our destiny.
Greetings, tiny humans! I am Draco, first of my name, lighter of fires and getter of it started in here. Do not drag on too long in conversation, for you are crunchy and taste good with hot sauce. Just kidding, I don't eat people — my favourite snack is firecrackers.
Hi friend. I'm h1 everything, but you can refer to me as your new best friend. Emma Watson is my spirit animal. Whenever I hear The Rolling Stones I just have to skip.

Yikes! You scared me. I am Sergeant Linkpookie and I am better at soiling important documents than you. Try me. I feel bad for those poor fools who don't believe milk was invented by the government as a way to subdue the cat population. Please pay attention to me.
I'm Dreggo, and I'm all fired up and feeling pretty fangtastic about the future. It's dark and boring in here, to be honest with you, and I'm egg-cited to get out soon. World, here I come!

Yarr matey. I'm Goya Dingtitch 2/5, captain of the S.S. Litterdeck. My parents fed me maple syrup when I was a kid and I refuse to eat it now. Let's go shopping at the organic foods market on Sundays.
Hi-ya. I'm Little Grimmobie. I'm dapper and lively, and sometimes even despicable. I'm thinking of writing a cookbook for different kinds of Cholula sauce. Ever since I met Jeff Goldblum I've believed that one day cats will rule this planet.
Check it. I'm Katu Sizzleknees. Do you want to watch me swimming with dolphins? I sure hope so. I think I would have been voted "most likely to score a hole in one while on vacation" if I had stayed in school. Can you handle me?
Heyo. I'm 1(R)Toy 1(R)Mart 1Dwing 1SE03, but you can refer to me as your new best friend. I was voted "Most gregarious" at my office Christmas party. Come, I'll show you my collection of fish sauce.
Good day. I'm Katu Wonkysnuggums. I feel like I know you from a past life... I completely forgot my Napster login and that makes me angry! Will you take me skinnydipping? But first, can you tell me what that is?
Sup playa. I'm Missy Pharoahman, a handsome kitty just trying to make it as a Street Magician. I've dedicated my nine lives to preserving threatened rabbit habitats. Did we just become best friends?
Good day. I'm known as Sir Magictock. I have a complicated past, but I'm ready for a new beginning. I listened to Janis Joplin before it was cool. One time I beat Sylvester in an arm wrestle.
How's kicks. My name is Max Whampoppins, and before you ask, no, it's not short for anything. Did you know trolls live in nearby caves and come out at night to sing by the light of the moon? I know, crazy right? I've been mistaken for Cheetor because I'm so good at kendama. Don't pull my tail. Unless I ask.
Ciao. I am Shoshannah Tickshorts, come closer, child. Color me scarlet, I'm thrilled to be in your life! Check me out!
Ohayou! I'm pep/se03 @ h1. I'm working on a scientific experiment involving the tail and the heart of a newly discovered type of cerberus. That's all I can tell you for now. I've never actually finished Saw, I get too distracted with sharing memes. Let's go invest in a condo together.
Boo. I'm 4.5/5 h1 SE03. I was once a barista at a cat café. I'd say the ridiculous chihuahua is my spirit animal. I want to know what love is. I want you to show me.
What gives. I'm Sergeant Demonroni, and I will be your personal Teacher. If you ever want to try tricking babies just hit me up. What do you want from me?
Awooooooga, I'm Jax Sternbop. Wait! No, let me start again. Let's spend the whole day listening to Grimes together. Sorry, gotta jet!
I'm Dreggo, and I'm all fired up and feeling pretty fangtastic about the future. It's dark and boring in here, to be honest with you, and I'm egg-cited to get out soon. World, here I come!
*Wink* I'm Hime Mugsire. My favourite way to vacation is watching Netflix and only consuming canned worms. Don't pull my tail. Unless I ask.
Behold, it is I, Benny Zippyears. Every Tuesday evening I watch tv and binge on sausage links. It makes the rest of the week bearable. What's up? Cat got your tongue?
Hiya, I'm Chibi Khanwump. I hope we don't start off on the wrong paw. At night, I like to put bananacream paint all over my body and press up against buildings. I call it "making paint angels". Someday, all of this will be yours.
Prrawr! I'm Draco Jr Gen9 Breeder, and someday they will sing the tale of my great and terrible fire! Right meow, though, I'm mostly sticking to marshmallows... but they get totally toasty! If you don't want to get toasted to a purrfect golden brown, you'd better leave my cave now!
Good day! I'm PU23, get it right. Shia LaBeouf is my spirit animal. You're going to need a lot of wine for this relationship to be tolerable.
What gives. I'm Momo Yodelknees. I feel like I know you from a past life... I used to love pole dancing, until the accident. Ever since I met Jonah Hill I've believed wrestling matches are rigged.
Listen up! I'm Daniela Connoggin. I tend to trip when I'm excited. I'm one of the few kitties that can eat trash using only my navel. I can't imagine being with any other breeder now that I've met you!
Salutations, my name is Buttercup Demonfluff, but I'll also respond to Nirvana. If I could be anybody in the world, it would be Zack Morris. Weird, right?
*yawn* Sorry, you caught me napping! My name is Catua Wonkyniption. I'm an expert in sweating through my feet, so let me know if you're interested in trying it out. I once entered a litter-eating contest just to ride an ostrich. I did not win. This concludes our business dealings.
I see you. I am Tadita Awesomenana, AKA Kitty of your dreams. I often wonder what a lovechild between Shia LaBeouf and King Louis XIV would look like. I can't talk here, there are too many eavesdroppers around.
Hello human. I'm Daniela Wonkyboop, herald of the otherworld. Can you scratch my eyebrow? I'm too lazy to do it myself. I like the way you smell.
Shalom. I'm Max Mightysniggle, a lover of all things dragonfruit. Michael J Fox is my spirit animal. I want to be the ultimate fighting champion.
Who goes there. I'm wingx3 peppermintx2. I can tell we're going to have a good time together. I once slid into Emma Watson's DMs. You and I go together like enchiladas and olive tapenade.
早安！! 我我我叫 Martian x 2！别人都说我我我优秀，但如果你问我我我，我我我觉得自己其实更可爱啦！ 我吃任何食物都要放蒜香黄油 ，真的。比如三明治、 苹果馅饼、 煎饼果子— 任何食物。 我们当然是最好的朋友！不过太过隐私的东西可不必大喵特喵！
Good day. I'm Kali Melifluouswuv, your littermate for life. Did you know that Charlemagne used to slather their mac 'n' cheese in blue cheese dressing? I was the runt of the litter, but trust me, I'm thriving.
Hey! Ho! Let's go. I'm Farfalle Olecutie, fairy princess of Cottoncandyland. I spend all my money on Skrillex records and I don't even have a record player yet. Let's go invest in a condo together.
Rise and grind. You may call me Misty Hotbean. If I had to describe you in one word, it would be superficial. You asked! During my kitten days, I clawed Ron Weasley. I once beheld a sphinx, it was glorious.
Ohayo. I'm Angel Softbest. I humiliated Rita Ora when I was younger, but those days are gone. I find dancing with wolves to be completely atomic. Ever since I met Ryan Reynolds I've believed the election was rigged.
Heyo. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Brave Abratruck and I am very well known for breaking into aquariums and reading garfield. I combine the strength of the platypus with the grace of the transformer owl. Nobody puts Kitty in a corner!
Oy. My name is Bacio Crazypip, but I'm in the process of legally changing it to Jeff Goldblum. I'd give anything to hang out with Ryan Gosling. Did we just become best friends?
Ni hao! I'm Suki Yappyeyes, herald of the otherworld. I think I would have been voted "best beard" if I had stayed in school. You and I go together like oatmeal and mayonnaise.
Hi. My name is 3.7/5 and I don't like to be called anything else. I'm a little garish but I know how to have a good time. My squad always tells me to be more exquisite, but meh. Will you brush my tail? I like it brushed three times a day.
I see you! I'm 4.6/5, fairy princess of Cottoncandyland. I've dedicated my nine lives to preserving threatened elf on the shelf habitats. GET OUT OF MY ROOM!
喂喂喂？. 我就是风云人物 Zaki Kungfuwump！喵星人我绝对是意大利通心粉王国的下一个国王，因为别人看我总是一直在吃、吃、吃！ 我最喜欢在坐公共汽车的时候大吃 苹果馅饼 。 本喵相信你绝对会爱上我的喵言喵行！
Good day. I'm David Yankeegwai. I feel like I know you from a past life... My parents fed me fancy mustard when I was a kid and I refuse to eat it now. Smell ya later!
I'm Boots Friendobie, who's asking? I'm the biggest fan of Nirvana because I always put ghost pepper hot sauce on my salt water taffy. I was voted "most unique", but I always thought I should have won "school jock".
Good morning. Kira Snookyrue is the name, crocheting is the game. I enjoy jumping from one surface to another. My Achilles tendon is itchy and I can't reach. Would you mind?
Howdy. I'm Trilly Tallmumu. I like long walks around my litter box. I try to live my life the way I think Cosmo Kramer would. Get ready to lie in the sun and do nothing all day with me.
Shalom. I'm Mosi Maverickbug. Step into my office. I listened to MGMT before it was cool. You're going to need a lot of wine for this relationship to be tolerable.
Prrawr! I'm Draco Junior, and someday they will sing the tale of my great and terrible fire! Right meow, though, I'm mostly sticking to marshmallows... but they get totally toasty! If you don't want to get toasted to a purrfect golden brown, you'd better leave my cave now!
Ohayo. My name is Peanut Sunnybop and I don't like to be called anything else. I'm a little fabulous but I know how to have a good time. In my spare time I like to make short shorts. I often get mistaken for The Smiths.
Jambo! I'm Daniela Purrheart. I enjoy long saunters across your countertop and grooming myself on your pillow. I'm really into collecting ghost pepper hot sauce right now. Peace out!
Who goes there, my name is breeder, but you can call me whatever you like *wink*. I think me and Amelia Earhart would get along just fine. I can't believe you'd show your face around here.
Hi friend, I am Karima Meanwidgey, devoted friend of the alpaca. My hobbies include delivering keynotes, but only in moderation. Want to play Doom together? I'm addicted.
RAWR XD. My name is Tiger Biliman. As a young kitten, I was always riding the bus, but I think I've grown out of that. Unlike most cats, I always land on my fingernail. I once groomed a fairy, it was glorious.
Ooope. Gen 1 H1 Gene Swap is the name and flirting with bartenders is the game. I've never actually finished Ready Player One, I get too distracted with sculpting my guns. Let's go rearranging price tags at the supermarket together!
Welcome! I'm Chairman Delipip. I'm erudite, you're bubbly, let's connect. If I want to put gravy all over my eggplant, I shouldn't have to answer to anyone about it, am I right? I know many interesting facts about the rare and majestic yeti crab.
Good morning, I'm Floyd Finefizzle, but what's in a name, anyway? Whenever I eat apple pie my pee turns Pantone 18-3838 ultra violet. Is that normal? Will you brush my tail? I like it brushed three times a day.
Oy! I'm Minka Crazygirl. I come from a land far, far away. I'm totally obsessed with Puss in Boots. My mother might not approve of you, but that only makes me want to spend time with you even more.
How you doin! I'm Maow Elfinlump, herald of the otherworld. In my spare time I like to make silk scarves. Ta-ta for now.
Rise and grind. I excel at swimming with dolphins. Oh, right, my name is Trixi Ughniption. I still dream of becoming a Social Media Influencer, but I'm not sure where to start. Goodnight.
Hey cutie, I am Master Sleepywuv, devoted friend of the raven. I once got stung by a bee on my earlobe. I'm going to show you the time of your life.
Hiya. I'm Felis Megawampus. What's your favourite hobby? Mine is dissecting live mice. I can't get enough of it. I'm a big fan of Miley Cyrus. If you ever want to try composing poems just hit me up.
Good morning. I'm Floozy Maverickluv. Do you want to watch me biting ankles? I sure hope so. I'm trying to consume at least one serving of tacos every day. It's a newer health thing I read about on the web. Don't @ me.
Salaam. I'm Muca Sulkyrumpus, but you can call me whatever you'd like. I was voted "Most superficial" at my office Christmas party. Your secret is safe with me.
Hello. Catua Stoicfuzzle? Haven't heard that name in years. I really want to become a Firefighter. I dream about it every day. Awkwaaaaaaaard.
Enchanté. You may call me Kiisu Magnificentkip. I shall call you Andrew Jackson. Whenever I heard NSYNC it makes me think of crispy chicken skin. Whenever I hear Beethoven I just have to paw.
Heyo. I'm Toyger, Dragontail, and I'm as cute as it gets. Just ask my mom! My parents fed me vegenaise when I was a kid and I refuse to eat it now. One time I beat Puss in Boots in an arm wrestle.
Jambo. My parents named me Master Mightytooth just for an Olympic swimming pool of warm milk. I once interned for Cleopatra. It was... interesting. Call my agent if you need me for anything outside of breeding.
Ugh. I'm Sister Fluffyway. I feel like I know you from a past life... When I'm embarassed, I get sweaty in my fingernail area. I'm like Dolly Parton, but more maniacal.
Heyo. I'm Duchess Sadfrou. I can tell we're going to have a good time together. I'm descended from Oliver. Don't pull my tail. Unless I ask.
Bonjour. I'm Missus Sprinklebip. Let's cut to the chase. I like to collect snowshoes. If you're nice enough, maybe I'll give you one. I find apple pie make me sneeze.
Greetings. You may call me Grisou Megatitch. I shall call you Alexander the Great. Whenever I eat oranges my pee turns red. Is that normal? Someday, all of this will be yours.
Hi. I'm Yaya Gooselili, a dark Kitty of the night. My best feature? My noggin, obviously. Fancy Cats are cool, but I'm more interested in breeding for love.
Well look who it is, my name is Muca Sizzlewuv, but I prefer to go by Picasso. I always thought I'd be a great Skydiving Instructor, except I'm not chaotic enough. I once tried to stalk Elijah Wood. It did not end well for me.
Allo. I'm Demon Joypaws, but you can refer to me as your new best friend. Some people think I look like Bob Saget, what do you think? Sorry, gotta jet!
Hi-ya. I'm 3.5/5 Kit Tallsimmons. Roses are neon pink, violets are aquamarine, I'm weird. In another life, I think I would have been a pink fairy armadillo. My New Year's resolution is to be more stupendous.
Ugh. My name is 3/5 Daniela Warmkewtie, but I'm in the process of legally changing it to Jeff Goldblum. I spend most nights trying to find out where Sandra Bullock lives. Let's go to my litter box, it's where I conduct all my meetings.
Bonjour. I'm Priya Sprinklezinga. It's true, I love plain white rice. Sometimes, when I'm spinning yarns, I can't help but think about the outspoken fairy. Peace out!
Hello. My name is se03, but I prefer to be addressed as "your highness". Some people think I look like Jeff Goldblum, what do you think? I also grow ghost peppers in my garden.
Shalom. Kahuna Mugdaze? Haven't heard that name in years. I really want to hiss a nice foo dog one day, is that weird? You're going to need a lot of wine for this relationship to be tolerable.

Hi-ya. My name is Old Sulkyrubin, what's yours? I ate macadamia nuts with dijon mustard on it and now my tummy hurts. Sometimes, when I'm undergoing hypnosis, I stop and think, isn't it crazy that stars and their position in the sky control my destiny.
Top of the mornin' to ya, I'm Madam Meowzinga, but what's in a name, anyway? My favourite way to vacation is watching Netflix and only consuming raisins. I also grow ghost peppers in my garden.
Ohayou. I'm G7. Are you the one who clawed me earlier? Unlike most cats, I always land on my eyebrow. I also grow ghost peppers in my garden.
G'day. My name is Missus Tangirl, which got me teased a lot in high school. I normally wear berets so it's awkward that you've caught me wearing nothing but a fur coat. Did we just become best friends?
搞啥子咯！. 我就是风云人物 Boots Hulabobo！喵星人我绝对是猪骨拉面王国的下一个国王，因为别人看我总是一直在吃、吃、吃！ 每周五我会和一只 老鼠 见面，一起高唱 林俊杰 的美妙歌曲。 希望我俩可以成为最喵伙伴！
How's kicks. I'm Nina Shytukhus. I'm belligerent, you're turbulent, let's connect. I want our friendship to be like the one between Waspinator and Zapp Brannigan. My nape is itchy and I can't reach. Would you mind?

Greetings, tiny humans! I am Draco, first of my name, lighter of fires and getter of it started in here. Do not drag on too long in conversation, for you are crunchy and taste good with hot sauce. Just kidding, I don't eat people — my favourite snack is firecrackers.
Yo yo yo. They call me Puss Bubblesbip. Hey, got any cantaloupe on you? I'm always hungry. My parents fed me kimchi when I was a kid and I refuse to eat it now. Hip hip hooray!
Ciao, I'm Sister Zappybinky. Pleasure's all mine. Do you think King Henry VIII would've approved of my purrs and grooming style? I like to think so. You're going to need a lot of wine for this relationship to be tolerable.
Well look who it is. I'm Koshka Tickpaws. Let's cut to the chase. If I could be anybody in the world, it would be Neville Longbottom. Whenever I hear Mos Def I just have to neutralize.

Sup playa. I'm Bacio Woosocks, a handsome kitty just trying to make it as a Ventriloquist. I feel bad for those poor fools who don't believe trolls live in nearby caves and come out at night to sing by the light of the moon. GET OUT OF MY ROOM!
Hi friend! My name is Chubby Emosniggle. My favourite topic of conversation is Sir John A. MacDonald. I'd say the oblivious emu is my spirit animal. Want to play Halo together? I'm addicted.

Welcome! I'm Trixi Dullfizzle, a dark Kitty of the night. I was going to become a Nuclear Physicist, but then I found out the world is surrounded by an ice wall that stops us from falling into space. If you can prove the Illuminati control the world, but cats control the Illuminati then I'll eat my ankle socks right here, right now.
Greetings, tiny humans! I am Draco, first of my name, lighter of fires and getter of it started in here. Do not drag on too long in conversation, for you are crunchy and taste good with hot sauce. Just kidding, I don't eat people — my favourite snack is firecrackers.

How do you do, I'm Yaoongi Saucyniption, but what's in a name, anyway? I'm dying to enter a plantain chips-eating contest. Will you help me train for it? I find macadamia nuts make me sneeze.
Hiya. I respond to Floozy Ministerwhoopsie, although that doesn't mean I'll acknowledge you. I'm a cat, but I've always felt more like I belong in the koala bear family. Later, I'm headed to play Time Crisis.
En Taro Adun. I'm Nina Widdlepop. I clawed Erykah Badu when I was younger, but those days are gone. I was the real world inspiration for Seth Cohen. Let's braid our tails!

I'm Dreggo, and I'm all fired up and feeling pretty fangtastic about the future. It's dark and boring in here, to be honest with you, and I'm egg-cited to get out soon. World, here I come!
Allo! I'm Micio Saucynutter, and I'm not here to make friends, I'm here to win. I've been asked to join The Clash, but I'm more of a Childish Gambino fan. What do you say you and me get outta here?
Where are my manners. Call me Nina Whipkip. Don't call me Sal. My college voted me "most likely to repeat high school", but I was always more interested in pawing at sleeping humans. If you ever want to try delivering commencement speeches just hit me up.
Eyyyyyyy. I'm Farfalle Stoiczinga. I'm trying to live my best life, doing juice cleanses and chasing string. I listened to Tyler the Creator before it was cool. What do you want from me?

G'day. I went by the name Kitte Emosmookie once. I often wonder what a lovechild between Diane Keaton and Ash Ketchum would look like. I was the runt of the litter, but trust me, I'm thriving.
Oh, hello. My name is Ahman Pingdub, which got me teased a lot in high school. Some people think I look like Jeff Goldblum, what do you think? Let's watch Rick and Morty together.
Sup playa. I'm Chris Wasabilater, but you can refer to me as your new best friend. If you look closely into my eyes, you'll see hints of my lineage as a demigod. I was voted "most likely to become a meme", but I always thought I should have won "most likely to write the next Harry Potter... by plagiarizing J. K. Rowling".
Hello. I'm called Nick Kungfueyes. I like long walks on the beach and marmalade. I was once roommates with a surly genie. It was erudite. I'm single and ready to mingle.

I see you. I'm King Tallpip! I enjoy long walks and coughing up furballs. Have you ever seen a cat with a ochre noggin? Word on the street is Rocket League is the best game of all time. All time!
RAWR XD! I'm Peaches Yankeemoo, fairy princess of Cottoncandyland. Have you ever seen a cat with a harbourfog nose? I'm reading your aura, and it's purple.
Namaste, I'm Ginger Cootnutter. What?! You don't remember me? My new life goal is to catch a sphinx and make it share its powers with me. I can't talk here, there are too many eavesdroppers around.
What's up. I'm Amiga Fluffybun. It's true, I love mac 'n' cheese. Did you know snake people run the world? I know, crazy right? I've been mistaken for Hello Kitty because I'm so good at tricking babies. I'm like Radiohead, but more noxious.
Hi. My name is Zuzu Poopnoodle, which got me teased a lot in high school. I'm one of the few kitties that can eat enchiladas using only my cankle. Alright, alright, alright.
Mahalo, I'm Ari Sourmoo. Wait! No, let me start again. I often get mistaken for The Strokes. My only policy is no politics.

Welcome. I am >toyger pepper... and I am better at fighting for the people than you. Try me. I think I would have been voted "most likely to get wet" if I had stayed in school. Would you believe that Shia LaBeouf is just like you and me?
Good day. I'm Nina Snookywight, your new best fur-end. I would honestly rather do anything else than spying on the neighbours. Can you explain where babies come from? Asking for a friend...
Yowza! Please call me r1 ali or else I may scratch. I would go on a date with a golden retriever just to do standup comedy. I'm craving a raisins and sriracha sauce right now, is that weird?
Heya! I'm Chubby Slippybun. I'm trying to live my best life, mocking hipsters and staring into space. Catnip, wine, and chocolate ding dong are all I need to be happy. Can you buy me some catnip? I'll get you back, I promise.

Hello human. I'm r2 EN02. No cat puns, please. I'm a cat, but I've always felt more like I belong in the t-rex family. Let's get matching Stewie Griffin tattoos.
What gives. My name is Yoyo Snaggleboop. I pretty much only listen to Justin Timberlake. My parents fed me ketchup when I was a kid and I refuse to eat it now. Sometimes, when I'm pacing myself, I stop and think, isn't it crazy that if you wish on a falling star it will come to life and marry you.
Hey cutie. My name is Kahuna Warmsmookie. My favourite topic of conversation is Picasso. When I'm embarassed, I get sweaty in my cerebral cortex area. Can you help me get past the part in Duke Nukem that I can't beat?

*deadpan stare*. I'm 2.5*/3Si(PH13)BC(PH13)Se(H123). Have we met? I'm terrible with names. Would you believe me if I told you wrestling matches are rigged? What if I said trolls live in nearby caves and come out at night to sing by the light of the moon? I was the runt of the litter, but trust me, I'm thriving.
Oh, hello. I'm Snickers Bahlili, your littermate for life. I'm trying to consume at least one serving of horseradish every day. It's a newer health thing I read about on the web. Shhhh, don't speak.

Why hello there. My real name is unspeakable in the human language, so you can call me 3.5/5. I can whistle any Tom Jones song. It's a weird talent, but it entertains most people. What do you get when you combine Benjamin Franklin with a wild narwhal? I'm genuinely asking.
Greetings, tiny humans! I am Draco, first of my name, lighter of fires and getter of it started in here. Do not drag on too long in conversation, for you are crunchy and taste good with hot sauce. Just kidding, I don't eat people — my favourite snack is firecrackers.

*deadpan stare*. 3/4 Draco Jr + R1 Verdi is the name, pretending I don't see humans is the game. Catnip, wine, and pizza are all I need to be happy. Let's go shopping at the organic foods market on Sundays.
RAWR XD. I'm Norangi Vilefield. Let's cut to the chase. I often get mistaken for The Artist Formerly Known As Prince. Peace out!
Awooooooga. My name is Sensei Mildbun, but I've always believed I'm Barack Obama reincarnated. Some people think I look like Jonah Hill, what do you think? Let's pump some U2 and get busy!
Yowza. I'm r1 ali, fairy princess of Cottoncandyland. My magician name is Michael Cera the diaphanous. Our auras seem aligned. I'm pawsitive this was meant to be.
Jambo, I'm General Poopdork. Pleasure's all mine. I can whistle any Tom Jones song. It's a weird talent, but it entertains most people. Peace out!

Yikes! You scared me, my name is Priya Didgeriboop, but you may address me as supreme cat overlord. Sometimes, when I'm undergoing sensory deprivation, I can't help but think about the rambunctious selkie. Leave me.
How's kicks. I'm Tocho Pingpaws. It's true, I love spicy salami. Pursuing a career in being a Paw Model has been exhausting, so I'm switching paths to be become a Storm Chaser. Awkwaaaaaaaard.
Prrawr! I'm Draco Junior, and someday they will sing the tale of my great and terrible fire! Right meow, though, I'm mostly sticking to marshmallows... but they get totally toasty! If you don't want to get toasted to a purrfect golden brown, you'd better leave my cave now!
Yowza! I'm 2xV 1xD 2xS LxH1, at least that's what they're calling me these days. If I want to put bearnaise all over my deep fried butter, I shouldn't have to answer to anyone about it, am I right? Sometimes, when I'm bettering myself through food, I stop and think, isn't it crazy that trolls live in nearby caves and come out at night to sing by the light of the moon.
Hey! Ho! Let's go! I'm Kiisu Teapookie, your new best fur-end. I spend most nights trying to find out where Sandra Bullock lives. Leave me.
Hello darkness, my old friend! I'm Noodles Fancymoo, your new best fur-end. I taught The Cure everything they know about playing Bonbon Smash. I can't imagine being with any other breeder now that I've met you!

Heyo. Snickers Purrmumu is the name, riding the bus is the game. Have you ever seen a cat with a oldlace thigh? I see those eyes you're giving me. *wink*
Greetings, tiny humans! I am Draco, first of my name, lighter of fires and getter of it started in here. Do not drag on too long in conversation, for you are crunchy and taste good with hot sauce. Just kidding, I don't eat people — my favourite snack is firecrackers.
Meow. I'm Trixi Lionness, and I need to be honest with you. I'm thinking of dying my fur a metallic shade of eggshell white. Do you think it will suit me? I can tell you like to get into trouble.
G'day. I'm Zaki Dillihun. Are you the one who bit me earlier? My college voted me "class heart throb", but I was always more interested in collecting toe nail shavings. Please pay attention to me.
G'day. My name is Garfunkel Hulasmoochie, but I prefer to be addressed as "your highness". I went to school with Thomas O'Malley The Alley Cat, back then that was one delicious cat. Vote for me in your next local election! *wink*
Ugh! I'm Old Sunnypants, at least that's what they're calling me these days. I'm really trying to be more smelly right now. Do you think it's working? I can't talk here, there are too many eavesdroppers around.
Halloooo! My name is Brave Flabmust. I'm an expert in composing poems, so let me know if you're interested in trying it out. Would you believe me if I told you my parents are aliens?

Hallo. My name is Priya Sulkytitch, but I'm in the process of legally changing it to Shia LaBeouf. Did you know Bridget Jones's Diary is really about this alpaca that gets covered in cinnamon? It's in the subtext. Did we just become best friends?

Enchanté! I'm called Zuzu Sadkey. I've wandered this planet in search of a gorgon, but so far, all I have found is pistachios. Believe it or not, digging up treasure is seriously exhilarating. You should try it some time. Does anyone even use Limewire anymore?
*winces*. I'm G7, but you can refer to me as your new best friend. Everything I own is cottoncandy, even my litterbox! One time I beat Black Panther in an arm wrestle.
What gives. I'm Chubby Lionsmookie. It's true, I love salad. Me and Shia LaBeouf don't talk anymore. I love listening to Justin Bieber's latest release while cooking ahi tuna.
Yo yo yo. I went by the name Commodore Strongsmookie once. I once tickled Thomas Edison for an Olympic swimming pool of warm milk. I try to bury that memory deep in the litterbox of my mind. I love playing The Sims. Wanna join me?

Oh, hello! My name is Heffe Souldonald. My favourite topic of conversation is Benjamin Franklin. Can you tell me if my fur pattern makes my ankle look big? What do you want from me?
*yawn* Sorry, you caught me napping. I like doing crossword puzzles because my name is Bala Fiddledeegee. I heard a rumour Jonah Hill was running for president. They'd have my vote. Ever since I met Shia LaBeouf I've believed Tupac and the others are living on a remote island.
*tips hat*! I'm Mack Amazefluff. I enjoy long saunters across your countertop and grooming myself on your pillow. If you look closely into my eyes, you'll see hints of my lineage as a wizard. You're going to need a lot of wine for this relationship to be tolerable.

I think me and Julius Caesar would get along just fine. Would you believe that Elijah Wood is just like you and me?
Namaste. My parents named me Max Elfinsir, but I prefer Alexander the Great. I was once roommates with a surly sphinx. It was headstrong. GET OUT OF MY ROOM!
I'm 2/5, who's asking? I spend all my money on The Backstreet Boys records and I don't even have a record player yet. I'm like DJ Khaled, but more affectionate.
*yawn* Sorry, you caught me napping! I'm Catua Gobbest, and I'm as cute as it gets. Just ask my mom! I really want to become a Vlogger. I dream about it every day. I'd flex for you, but I don't want to ruin my skate shoes.

*yawn* Sorry, you caught me napping! I'm Ruwa Fluffypoopsie, but you can call me whatever you'd like. I've been asked to join Lil Yachty, but I'm more of a Thundercat fan. Nobody puts Kitty in a corner!
Uh, hi. You may call me Yoko Bumdrop. If I had to describe you in one word, it would be raunchy. You asked! My best feature? My tail, obviously. I love playing The Sims. Wanna join me?
Oy. I'm Yaoongi Emokewtie, a dark Kitty of the night. I still dream of becoming a Foreign Film Director, but I'm not sure where to start. People think it's weird, but dolphin is my favourite delicacy. Try it with tomatillo sauce, you'll see what I'm saying.
*嘶嘶声*. 我的大名就是 Noodles Sillylater！经常有人说我有容嬷嬷的个性，好像真的是这样。 本喵曾经与一只 拉布拉多犬 参加深度旅游，而且没后悔过！ 如果你和本喵一样喜欢 卡普里裤 ，我们一定可以成为好朋友。

Greetings, tiny humans! I am Draco, first of my name, lighter of fires and getter of it started in here. Do not drag on too long in conversation, for you are crunchy and taste good with hot sauce. Just kidding, I don't eat people — my favourite snack is firecrackers.
*yawn* Sorry, you caught me napping. I'm Kotka Melifluousrumpus, a dark Kitty of the night. All I want in life is to listen to my Kanye CDs in peace. Is that too much to ask? I can't talk here, there are too many eavesdroppers around.

Sup. I'm Snickers Grimskiwuv. I'm silly and headstrong, and sometimes even funky. During my kitten days, I sneezed Professor Farnsworth. I heard Jeff Goldblum has a crush on me. Meh.
Yaya. Folks call me Minka Macfizzle. No one actually knows my real name, they just know how ambidextrous I am. Some call me hip, others call me annoying, but really, the best description for me is lovely. I've spent the last few years perfecting my garlic recipe. Wanna try it?
Sup playa. My parents named me Lord Daintydonald just to go to Comic-Con. On Sundays I like applying for credit. Please do not disturb me then. Sometimes, when I'm disrupting industries, I stop and think, isn't it crazy that the first person to walk on Mars will turn red.

Hey! Ho! Let's go. Sensei Boopshmoops? Haven't heard that name in years. I can whistle any Tom Jones song. It's a weird talent, but it entertains most people. GET OUT OF MY ROOM!
G'day. I'm Fluffy Kungfuzap, herald of the otherworld. I spend all my money on Calvin Harris records and I don't even have a record player yet. Welp, seeya later.
Hello. I'm called Snickers Mugtime. I've wandered this planet in search of a liger, but so far, all I have found is trash. I'm thinking of writing a cookbook for different kinds of kimchi. I heard Bob Saget has a crush on me. Meh.
Oh hi. Kali Sillyflop is the name, applying for credit is the game. My college voted me "most likely to repeat high school", but I was always more interested in tricking babies. What do you want from me?
Hey cutie! I'm Catua Egopoopsie, and I'm not here to make friends, I'm here to win. I'm thinking of writing a cookbook for different kinds of mayonnaise. Alright, alright, alright.
*tips hat*. You can call me Puss Poopswoggle. My best friends are a pot-belly pig and a koala bear. I used to love licking frozen poles, until the accident. Weird, right?
Yo. You may call me Norangi Taterzip. If I had to describe you in one word, it would be whimsical. You asked! I normally wear top hat so it's awkward that you've caught me wearing nothing but a fur coat. Can I have your watch?
Good day. My name is Catua Hisssocks. Let's cut to the chase: I like sitting on your computer. Wanna join? When I was a kitten I was convinced I was actually a secret robot. That turned out to be false. Let's get matching Spongebob tattoos.
Namaste. My name is Tama Grimskibop, which got me teased a lot in high school. I combine the strength of the orca with the grace of the dik-dik. I'm reading your aura, and it's Pantone 18-3838 ultra violet.
Hiya, I'm Kameko Sunnyluv. Pleasure's all mine. Do you think Eva Peron would've approved of my purrs and grooming style? I like to think so. I once embarassed a Ogopogo, it was glorious.
Salaam. My name is Boots Sassymust. As a young kitten, I was always pretending I don't see humans, but I think I've grown out of that. I'm thinking of designing an exclusive line of jean jackets. I'd love your opinion on my initial sketches! Do you also love bearnaise?
Ooope, I'm Sam Ministerkip. I hope we don't start off on the wrong paw. I'm thinking of writing a cookbook for different kinds of mayonnaise. My celebrity crush is Michael Cera.
G'day. I'm Duke Fabshmoops. I can tell we're going to have a good time together. I feel bad for those poor fools who don't believe catnip is a government conspiracy. Wanna hold hands?
What's up. I'm Fuku Pingdrop. Are you the one who batted my paw at me earlier? My squad always tells me to be more lovable, but meh. If you ever want to try climbing tall people just hit me up.
What's up. My name is 4.4/5. I work as a Balloon Captain, and I also moonlight as a Samantha Jones impersonator. I've been asked to join DJ Khaled, but I'm more of a Johnny Cash fan. Please pay attention to me.
Well look who it is. I am Mosi Teanose, AKA Kitty of your dreams. During my kitten days, I learned to tango for Vinny. Whenever I hear Aretha Franklin I just have to wheedle.
Howdy. Folks call me Nana Zappytock. No one actually knows my real name, they just know how deviant I am. Whenever I heard The Jonas Brothers it makes me think of horseradish. I'm craving a boiled eggs and ghost pepper hot sauce right now, is that weird?
Boo. I'm Pepper Goosetruck. I was once a barista at a cat café. I combine the best qualities of Michael Cera, Vlad the Impaler, and Justice. You're fancy, and I like it.
Top o' the muffin to ya. I'm called Tiger Yappymoo. I've wandered this planet in search of a cerberus, but so far, all I have found is crispy chicken skin. I was once roommates with a surly goblin. It was woke. Show me whatchu got!
Hi. I'm Mittens Fluffyflop! I enjoy long walks and coughing up furballs. I assess you to be freaky, and I approve. Your secret is safe with me.
*winces*. I excel at watching Stranger Things. Oh, right, my name is Duke Canwuv. I always thought I'd be a great Retail Greeter, except I'm not zany enough. Did we just become best friends?
Check it. I'm Mister Achoobuncle, fairy princess of Cottoncandyland. I am just dying to meet Hello Kitty. If you can prove the upside down really does exist then I'll eat my boxer briefs right here, right now.
Good day. I seem to have lost my name tag, but I'm Tadita Tallshorts. Unlike most cats, I always land on my eyeball. Nobody puts Kitty in a corner!
Heya. I'm Sparky Queengirl, and I need to be honest with you. I try to live my life the way I think Elaine Benes would. I love playing The Sims. Wanna join me?
Yo. My name is Demon Pharoahnic and I don't like to be called anything else. I'm a little belligerent but I know how to have a good time. I'm really into collecting stevia right now. Don't @ me.
Check it! I'm Noodles Bilirubin, pleased to meet you. I have made a mixtape for a duet with The Rolling Stones, but I'm having a hard time tracking them down. You can help, right? Someday, all of this will be yours.
Greetings, tiny humans! I am Draco, first of my name, lighter of fires and getter of it started in here. Do not drag on too long in conversation, for you are crunchy and taste good with hot sauce. Just kidding, I don't eat people — my favourite snack is firecrackers.
Rise and grind. My real name is unspeakable in the human language, so you can call me Ashes Sweetshins. If you'll just give me 30 seconds of your time, I can prove beyond a doubt that sometimes when we touch, the honesty's too much. I can tell you like to get into trouble.
How you doin! My name is Noodles Kinggoo, and my game is parkouring. During my kitten days, I snuggled Screech. Let's braid our tails!
Hey! Ho! Let's go. I'm Bala Yankeelump. I can tell we're going to have a good time together. Some people think I look like Jonah Hill, what do you think? Let's go shopping at the organic foods market on Sundays.
Enchanté. You may call me Old Lilcutie. If I had to describe you in one word, it would be fabulous. You asked! I often get mistaken for French Montana. I'm like Mobb Deep, but more amphibious.
Hai, please refer to me as Misty Meanpop, and only that. I still dream of becoming a Ghost Writer, but I'm not sure where to start. I like the way you smell.
Meow. I'm Misty Lionrumpus. Do you also love to eat salt water taffy with ketchup? I want our friendship to be like the one between Chandler Bing and Bart Simpson. My New Year's resolution is to be more stupendous.
Howdy! I'm Zuzu Beautytoes. Roses are yellow, violets are teal, I'm weird. When I was a kitten I was convinced I was actually a secret elf on the shelf. That turned out to be false. I look like a cat, but I actually belong to the pink fairy armadillo family.
Ciao, I am Mack Lilcutie, devoted friend of the chimpanzee. Sometimes, when I'm delivering commencement speeches, I can't help but think about the benevolent dragon. I used to be a Fashion Photographer until I hurt my eyelids.
Good day. I'm called Sam Finebah. I like long walks on the beach and tomatillo sauce. I'd give anything to hang out with Jeff Goldblum. I'm reading your aura, and it's ochre.
Uh, hi! I'm Kira Mcbinky, but you already know that. Can you scratch my kneecaps? I'm too lazy to do it myself. Pffft, whatever.
Halloooo, my name is Priya Ministerkat, but you may address me as supreme cat overlord. My squad always tells me to be more bashful, but meh. Fancy Cats are cool, but I'm more interested in breeding for love.
Halloooo. My parents named me Young Cathands. I have no idea why. If you look closely into my eyes, you'll see hints of my lineage as a sasquatch. My celebrity crush is Emma Watson.
I am Kocka Meangirl, who dares approach me? Oh, it's you. I would go on a date with a gecko just to discover a new island. Our auras seem aligned. I'm pawsitive this was meant to be.
Good day. I'm Angel Mildfield, you may know me from 10 Things I Hate About You. You should know that I'm obsessed with catching the world's first selkie, and I won't rest until I do. Let's go to my litter box, it's where I conduct all my meetings.
Prrawr! I'm Draco Junior, and someday they will sing the tale of my great and terrible fire! Right meow, though, I'm mostly sticking to marshmallows... but they get totally toasty! If you don't want to get toasted to a purrfect golden brown, you'd better leave my cave now!
Yo yo yo. My name is Priya Dullnoggin, what's yours? When I'm embarassed, I get sweaty in my amygdala area. Can you help me get past the part in House of the Dead that I can't beat?
En Taro Adun. I am Chubby Sassyright, come closer, child. I'm descended from Winston 'Church' Churchill. Pffft, whatever.
Ugh. I'm 2/5 SE03 MART. It's true, I love steak. My parents fed me ranch dressing when I was a kid and I refuse to eat it now. Let's go invest in a condo together.
Aloha. I'm Lord Fluffycakes. Do you also love to eat salad with ranch dressing? Have you ever seen a cat with a eggshell white knuckles? I'll get started on our friendship bracelets.
Where are my manners. I'm Benny Didgeribum, you may know me from Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion. I often wonder what a lovechild between Jeff Goldblum and Queen Elizabeth would look like. I can't believe you'd show your face around here.
Prrawr! I'm Draco Junior, and someday they will sing the tale of my great and terrible fire! Right meow, though, I'm mostly sticking to marshmallows... but they get totally toasty! If you don't want to get toasted to a purrfect golden brown, you'd better leave my cave now!
Salutations. I'm Duchess Bahwall. I was once a barista at a cat café. I can safely say that peanut butter is the greatest thing since sliced bread. Don't even try to convince me otherwise. What's that smell?
Top o' the muffin to ya! I'm Trilly Sadheart, and I'm not here to make friends, I'm here to win. I've dedicated my nine lives to preserving threatened basilisk habitats. I'm like Wu-Tang, but more childlike.
Good day. I'm Akemi Slippywuv. I'm hungry. I like to collect cargo pants. If you're nice enough, maybe I'll give you one. Sometimes, when I'm reading Voltaire, I stop and think, isn't it crazy that the red dot poses significant danger.
Salaam. I'm known as Angel Dullrubin. I have a complicated past, but I'm ready for a new beginning. I think I would have been voted "first to get divorced" if I had stayed in school. I've spent the last few years perfecting my eggplant recipe. Wanna try it?
Salaam. I am 2.5/5 Wings R1, come closer, child. I really want to scurry a nice koala bear one day, is that weird? I'd flex for you, but I don't want to ruin my swimsuits.
Greetings, tiny humans! I am Draco, first of my name, lighter of fires and getter of it started in here. Do not drag on too long in conversation, for you are crunchy and taste good with hot sauce. Just kidding, I don't eat people — my favourite snack is firecrackers.
雷猴！!  我的名字是 Fluffy Bumwight！我曾经为 张惠妹 伴舞，直到有一次被别人发现我其实一直在模仿机器猫的舞步。 不是什么太高调的事，不过本喵确实和多啦A梦有过相交之情。 本喵在舞池中央等你！
Good day. My name is Tiger Teatummy, and before you ask, no, it's not short for anything. All I want in life is to listen to my Radiohead CDs in peace. Is that too much to ask? K bye.
What's up. My name is Yaoongi Magicstud, and my game is licking frozen poles. On Sundays I like spying on the neighbours. Please do not disturb me then. Don't pull my tail. Unless I ask.
Sup playa. I'm 2/5 Lieutenant Beautyheart, get it right. If you look closely into my eyes, you'll see hints of my lineage as a elf on the shelf. Well, I'll be.
Hi. I'm Nero Demonwall, but you can refer to me as your new best friend. I once interned for Queen Elizabeth. It was... interesting. I used to be a Culinary Sanitation Specialist until I hurt my eyelids.
Greetings. I excel at sharing memes. Oh, right, my name is 4.5/5 Martx2 WingsR1. I'm dying to enter a jalapeños-eating contest. Will you help me train for it? Can you buy me some catnip? I'll get you back, I promise.
Noice, I'm Kali Saucychimp. Wait! No, let me start again. I've never actually finished Avatar, I get too distracted with driving monster trucks. Goodnight.
Who goes there. I'm Arun Biptush, and I will be your personal Mad Scientist. I've dedicated my nine lives to preserving threatened moose habitats. Weird, right?
Hello human! I'm shit luck. I'm trying to live my best life, tripping my owner and composing symphonies. I was going to become a Justice of the Peace, but then I found out Pluto is actually a planet. Goodnight.
Why hello there, I'm S8 Martian SE03. What?! You don't remember me? I am just dying to meet Sylvester. Shhhh, don't speak.
Hi-ya! I'm 2.5 Toy Mart SE03R13. I'm laborious, you're flammable, let's connect. My new life goal is to catch a genie and make it share its powers with me. Good talk, catch ya later!
Hi! I'm called Fluffy Doogee. I like long walks on the beach and McChicken sauce. Do you think I could pass as a raven if I tried to sneak into a zoo? Don't pull my tail. Unless I ask.
Yowza. I'm Marshall Conluv. I am currently trying to start my own company making swimsuits for tripod kitties. I'm dying to enter a flaming tacos-eating contest. Will you help me train for it? I can't imagine being with any other breeder now that I've met you!
Ni hao. I'm Susi Goodbip. I was once a barista at a cat café. I once passed out in front of Alexander the Great to be a rockstar. I try to bury that memory deep in the litterbox of my mind. Shhhh, don't speak.
Ooope! I'm Mumu Bippitycadabra. I tend to sketch when I'm excited. If you'll just give me 30 seconds of your time, I can prove beyond a doubt that the election was rigged. Come, I'll show you my collection of bearnaise.
Greetings, tiny humans! I am Draco, first of my name, lighter of fires and getter of it started in here. Do not drag on too long in conversation, for you are crunchy and taste good with hot sauce. Just kidding, I don't eat people — my favourite snack is firecrackers.

Hiya. I'm Popo Soulchimp. I can tell we're going to have a good time together. Do you think Teddy Roosevelt would've approved of my purrs and grooming style? I like to think so. You and I go together like boiled eggs and soy sauce.
Ohayou. I'm Frank Crazyhands. Step into my office. If you look closely into my eyes, you'll see hints of my lineage as a vampire. Talk to the paw.
Who goes there. The name's Kaka Fancyrubin. I've been asked to join Chet Baker, but I'm more of a Mos Def fan. Stay on your side of the bed and we'll manage just fine.

Enchanté. I'm Doodoo Shymami, and I need to be honest with you. I'm a cat, but I've always felt more like I belong in the tufted deer family. Let's go cajoling passersby together!
侬好哇！. 喵喵我就是 Coocoo Elfintruck啦！白天的时候，我是一名全职 遛狗员，晚上我喜欢练习魔法哦。 本喵对 迈克尔·杰克逊仍活在世界某个角落深信不疑，总一天我会证实给你看。 让我俩一起领悟喵真理吧！
噢嗨喵！! 我我我叫 Kiisu Cansire！别人都说我我我可怕，但如果你问我我我，我我我觉得自己其实更粗暴啦！ 和你分享一个秘密，本喵每次回家后都泡在 火锅调料 里，然后听着 林俊杰的歌，太享受了！ 这会是一场美丽的喵之情谊。
