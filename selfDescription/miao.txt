How do you do. I'm Katze Mildnana. Are you the one who pranced with me earlier? Color me salmon pink, I'm thrilled to be in your life! I find sausage links make me sneeze.
Why hello there! I'm Tadita Meansir. What's your favourite hobby? Mine is pole dancing. I can't get enough of it. I'm thinking of writing a cookbook for different kinds of mayonnaise. Don't pull my tail. Unless I ask.
Good day. My name is Midnight Dillifu. Let's cut to the chase: I like practicing radical self care. Wanna join? Everything I own is cottoncandy, even my litterbox! I also grow ghost peppers in my garden.
Hi-ya, my name is Muca Sadpip, but you can call me whatever you like *wink*. I always thought I'd be a great Cosmonaut, except I'm not tantalizing enough. Wanna hold hands?
Shalom. Gen 0 is the name, dissecting live mice is the game. I'm really trying to make it as a FBI Agent. Spending my nights catching leprechauns probably isn't helping, though. I'm going to show you the time of your life.
Greetings. Please call me Coocoo Lubsmookie or else I may scratch. I like trying to swallow ribbons at the lunar new year. Can you handle me?
Salutations! I'm Catastrophe Scootchhickey, and you're cute. If you can guarantee our relationship will be flammable, we're good here. Don't cross me and we'll be just fine.
Hi, I'm PU21. And you are? I can safely say that hummus is the greatest thing since sliced bread. Don't even try to convince me otherwise. I was voted "most changed since freshman year", but I always thought I should have won "best dresser".
How you doin. I'm Tora Khanmuffin. I enjoy long saunters across your countertop and grooming myself on your pillow. What do you prefer to eat when standing on your human's head? I like meatloaf. I know many interesting facts about the rare and majestic rabbit.
I see you! I'm Countess Zappyzap, get it right. At night, I like to put dragonfruit paint all over my body and press up against buildings. I call it "making paint angels". Does anyone even use Angelfire anymore?
RAWR XD! I'm Angel Sourwall, pleased to meet you. I'm really into collecting marmalade right now. Can you buy me some catnip? I'll get you back, I promise.
Hey! Ho! Let's go. I'm Floyd Abraroo, but you can call me whatever you'd like. If you look closely into my eyes, you'll see hints of my lineage as a shapeshifter. I want to know what love is. I want you to show me.
Hi-ya. I'm Nisse Ministersocks. I'm trying to live my best life, inheriting millions and disrupting industries. I was voted "Most victorious" at my office Christmas party. Can I have your watch?
Salutations. I'm Kira Dootukhus. I am currently trying to start my own company making corsets for tripod kitties. Can you tell me if my fur pattern makes my ankle look big? I used to be a Professional Sleeper until I hurt my calf.
Namaste. My parents named me breeder. I have no idea why. My squad always tells me to be more silly, but meh. Smell ya later!
Namaste. My name is breeder, and my game is practicing archery. My parents fed me peanut butter when I was a kid and I refuse to eat it now. If you ever want to try fad dieting just hit me up.
Ugh. Yaya Abrabun is the name, tipping glasses of water over is the game. Can you tell me if my fur pattern makes my knuckles look big? Let's pump some Luke Bryan and get busy!
How you doin, I'm breeder, but what's in a name, anyway? My best feature? My eyelid, obviously. I'm a kitty, you're a human, this friendship is our destiny.
Oh heyyy. My name is Sam Daintybobo. My favourite topic of conversation is Napoleon Bonaparte. In another life, I think I would have been a crocodile. Can you buy me some catnip? I'll get you back, I promise.

I must be the luckiest kitten in the world!

Eyyyyyyy. Marbles Kingfrou? Haven't heard that name in years. I'm trying this weird diet where I only eat oranges, I'll let you know how it goes. Sometimes, when I'm cutting my own bangs, I stop and think, isn't it crazy that the Illuminati run the banks.

Howdy. I excel at kickboxing. Oh, right, my name is Savannah. I'm really into collecting ghost pepper hot sauce right now. I can't believe you'd show your face around here.
Hallo. I'm Karima Fancynose, and my name is my name. Whenever I heard Lil Yachty it makes me think of cucumbers. Check me out!

Oh hi. I'm Azizi Sillytitch. I'm turbulent and diaphanous, and sometimes even inconsiderate. I completely forgot my Napster login and that makes me angry! Someday, all of this will be yours.
RAWR XD. I'm Martha, but you can refer to me as your new best friend. To be honest, stealing mints is all I'm really interested in. Alright, alright, alright.

Hi. I'm Sugar Yankeenic, and you're cute. I'm really trying to make it as a Storm Chaser. Spending my nights picking flowers probably isn't helping, though. In high school I was voted "most likely to cure the common cold" and it definitely came true.

Hello human, my name is Norangi Goosebip, but I'll also respond to Lady Gaga. I normally wear pencil skirts so it's awkward that you've caught me wearing nothing but a fur coat. Stay on your side of the bed and we'll manage just fine.
Ohayou! My name is Dieter Wonkydoo, and my game is swiping right. Cat Power wants me, but I'm more of a The Beatles fan. Do you also love marmite?

Welcome! I'm Gizmo Olestud. I tickled Joy Division when I was younger, but those days are gone. My college voted me "most likely to become a meme", but I was always more interested in licking frozen poles. I'm a kitty, you're a human, this friendship is our destiny.

Ni hao. I'm Madam Bluntboo, at least that's what they're calling me these days. I feel bad for those poor fools who don't believe the moon landing was produced by Steven Spielberg. I can't believe you'd show your face around here.

Hey, what's up, hello. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Chayim Elfinwidgey and I am very well known for drinking natural wines and glaring at the neighbour's cat. I combine the strength of the dog with the grace of the gecko. I'm single and ready to mingle.
Oh hi. My parents named me Count Amazebean, but I prefer Mother Teresa. Let's spend the whole day listening to Backstreet Boys together. I used to be a Back-End Developer / Personal Trainer until I hurt my tummy.
Oh heyyy. I'm Young Fineeyes. I already like you. Want to go shopping? We can get our claws painted. I don't have time for new friends, but I'll make an exception for you.
Yikes! You scared me. I'm Maow Waltzlink. Pleased to meet you. Whenever I eat horseradish my pee turns Pantone 18-3838 ultra violet. Is that normal? Let's pump some Pavarotti and get busy!
I see you, please refer to me as Lulu Flirtypip, and only that. I'm trying this weird diet where I only eat salad, I'll let you know how it goes. Goodnight.
Ciao. They call me Captain Megasmoosh. Hey, got any chocolate on you? I'm always hungry. If you look closely into my eyes, you'll see hints of my lineage as a gremlin. Hold my beer.

Oh hi. I'm Myeong Carrum. I'm working on a scientific experiment involving the belly and the heart of a newly discovered type of demigod. That's all I can tell you for now. I'm really trying to make it as a Spin Instructor. Spending my nights cooking up a storm probably isn't helping, though. Ta-ta for now.
How you doin. I excel at playing the tuba. Oh, right, my name is Rara Liondeedee. In another life, I think I would have been a sloth. Your secret is safe with me.

Howdy, I'm Precious Meanfluff, but what's in a name, anyway? If you look closely into my eyes, you'll see hints of my lineage as a centaur. What do you get when you combine Jane Austen with a wild rooster? I'm genuinely asking.

Top of the mornin' to ya. My parents named me Kira Waltzfu. I have no idea why. I once entered a litter-eating contest just for a bag of Doritos. I did not win. Whenever I hear Liberace I just have to swat.

Good morning, please refer to me as Mumu Dooeyes, and only that. Some people think I look like Jeff Goldblum, what do you think? Can you handle me?
Heyo! My real name is unspeakable in the human language, so you can call me Doctor Lubtukhus. I once flummoxed King Henry VIII for a bucket of shrimp. I try to bury that memory deep in the litterbox of my mind. I was the runt of the litter, but trust me, I'm thriving.

Hi friend! I'm Smokey Scrummygirl. I tend to grimace when I'm excited. I'm trying to consume at least one serving of sausage links every day. It's a newer health thing I read about on the web. Want to play Pac-Man together? I'm addicted.

How's it going. I respond to Muschi Ughpop, although that doesn't mean I'll acknowledge you. I was going to become a Brain Surgeon, but then I found out watermelon seeds will grow in your stomach. Sometimes, when I'm reinventing myself, I stop and think, isn't it crazy that trolls live in nearby caves and come out at night to sing by the light of the moon.

Allo. I'm called Nisse Goosecadabra. I've wandered this planet in search of a dragon, but so far, all I have found is lasagna. I normally wear knee-high socks so it's awkward that you've caught me wearing nothing but a fur coat. Can you handle me?
Noice. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Senator Snagglewall and I am very well known for crafting puns and singing in the shower. Do you think I could pass as a dumbo octopus if I tried to sneak into a zoo? Later, I'm headed to play Mega Man.

Hi friend. I respond to Trilly Daintypop, although that doesn't mean I'll acknowledge you. I often wonder what a lovechild between Bob Saget and Abraham Lincoln would look like. I'm craving a garlic and ghost pepper hot sauce right now, is that weird?

I'm Kottur Gunkfield, who's asking? I like applying for credit at the lunar new year. One time I beat Milo in an arm wrestle.
Rise and grind. I like shakin' dat booty because my name is Akemi Bluntfuzzle. Would you believe me if I told you Tupac and the others are living on a remote island? What if I said milk was invented by the government as a way to subdue the cat population? Also, I love McDonalds happy meals.
Ooope. I'm called Momo Pingsir. I like long walks on the beach and Tapatío. Believe it or not, spying on the neighbours is seriously exhilarating. You should try it some time. Did we just become best friends?
How's it going. I'm Nina Twinkleears, herald of the otherworld. I still dream of becoming a Veterinarian, but I'm not sure where to start. Fly, you fool.
What's up, my name is Tora Skookumtukhus, but I prefer to go by Blackbeard. I can whistle any Tom Jones song. It's a weird talent, but it entertains most people. Ta-ta for now.

Halloooo! I'm Demon Emomoo. I'm pretty sure I'm part gecko, I hope that doesn't bother you. At night, I like to put emerald green paint all over my body and press up against buildings. I call it "making paint angels". Welp, seeya later.

Noice. My name is Mr. Yo Kungfutummy, but I'm in the process of legally changing it to Jeff Goldblum. I've never actually finished Sixteen Candles, I get too distracted with cutting my own bangs. I was the runt of the litter, but trust me, I'm thriving.
Hark! I'm Pudding Whippop//Pu04. I think I would have been voted "most likely to become a meme" if I had stayed in school. I'm craving a chocolate ding dong and ranch dressing right now, is that weird?
How you doin. Señor Demonnano is the name, siring for status is the game. In my spare time I like to make socks. My celebrity crush is Shia LaBeouf.

Greetings. My name is Thor Bippitysmoochie, but I'm in the process of legally changing it to Diane Keaton. If I could be anybody in the world, it would be Starscream. I like the way you smell.
Hi. I seem to have lost my name tag, but I'm Suki Fiddledeenano. All I want in life is to listen to my Mac Demarco CDs in peace. Is that too much to ask? People think it's weird, but t-rex is my favourite delicacy. Try it with mango chutney, you'll see what I'm saying.
I'm Moses Souldub, how the hell are ya!? Beneath this tough exterior beats the heart of a wild yeti crab. Later, I'm headed to play Eve Online.

Hey cutie. I'm Boots Ughzinga. Have we met? I'm terrible with names. Can you tell me if my fur pattern makes my paws look big? Ever since I met Ryan Reynolds I've believed the world is surrounded by an ice wall that stops us from falling into space.
Hai. My real name is unspeakable in the human language, so you can call me Ginger Ahemlili. Did you know my parents are aliens? I know, crazy right? I've been mistaken for Hobbes because I'm so good at siring for status. Fancy Cats are cool, but I'm more interested in breeding for love.

Good day. You may call me old & new. My squad always tells me to be more ambidextrous, but meh. Call my agent if you need me for anything outside of breeding.
Welcome. My parents named me Catsup Bluemoo. I have no idea why. Believe it or not, sleeping in fresh laundry is seriously exhilarating. You should try it some time. I'm craving a filet of fish and mango chutney right now, is that weird?
Sup playa, I'm Biscuit Sprinkletime, but what's in a name, anyway? I think me and Cleopatra would get along just fine. My mother might not approve of you, but that only makes me want to spend time with you even more.

忙啥呢！! 认识我的人都管我叫 Manscape Elfinmust！若你也喜欢茶酱面，那我们就有话可聊啦！ 我吃任何食物都要放腐乳汁 ，真的。比如三明治、 披萨、 意大利通心粉— 任何食物。 愿我俩的友谊一代又一代地传下去！
Howdy. My name is Missus Tallsmoochie, and before you ask, no, it's not short for anything. Everything I own is mint green, even my litterbox! I love listening to Lauryn Hill's latest release while cooking chocolate.
Halloooo. Call me Chairman Greywidgey. Don't call me Sal. I'm descended from Chester Cheetah. My mother might not approve of you, but that only makes me want to spend time with you even more.
Hello darkness, my old friend. I'm Minou Flabheart. I like long walks around my litter box. Whenever I eat salt water taffy my pee turns cerulean. Is that normal? I see those eyes you're giving me. *wink*
Howdy. You may call me Amorita Twinklenoice. I shall call you King Louis XIV. I normally wear kid gloves so it's awkward that you've caught me wearing nothing but a fur coat. Want to play Angry Birds together? I'm addicted.

Boo! I'm Micio Cattyrubin, get it right. I went to school with Pink Panther, back then that was one heartwarming cat. Don't pull my tail. Unless I ask.
Noice. My name is Gaga Sporksir. I love to wear black. I once got stung by a bee on my kidney. People think it's weird, but t-rex is my favourite delicacy. Try it with McChicken sauce, you'll see what I'm saying.
*hissing noises*. My parents named me Tadita Zippyshins just to ban all dogs from chasing balls, just to see the look on their faces. I feel bad for those poor fools who don't believe wrestling matches are rigged. Don't ever leave me. I don't like being alone.
Heya. I am Young Tallzip. I'm glad you've come. Me and Jonah Hill don't talk anymore. This concludes our business dealings.
How you doin. I'm Chicco Warytail. I feel like I know you from a past life... I'm trying to consume at least one serving of cantaloupe every day. It's a newer health thing I read about on the web. What do you want from me?
Who goes there. I'm Amiga Fabmuffin, and I will be your personal Penguin Charmer. I'm really trying to be more exuberant right now. Do you think it's working? Until our next encounter...

Noice. I'm SE 16 alt. What's your favourite hobby? Mine is people-watching. I can't get enough of it. I feel bad for those poor fools who don't believe snake people run the world. Fancy Cats are cool, but I'm more interested in breeding for love.

Heyo. Folks call me Minka Wonkybop. No one actually knows my real name, they just know how erudite I am. To be honest, shooting clay pigeons is all I'm really interested in. Fancy Cats are cool, but I'm more interested in breeding for love.

Yaya! My name is Zizi Kungfufu. Let's get to know each other better. All I want in life is to listen to my Queen CDs in peace. Is that too much to ask? I'm reading your aura, and it's sky blue.

Top of the mornin' to ya. My name is Big Queenmumu, and before you ask, no, it's not short for anything. I heard a rumour Michael Cera was running for president. They'd have my vote. Ta-ta for now.
*tips hat*. I'm Misty Didgeribow, and you're cute. I still dream of becoming a Dairy Farmer, but I'm not sure where to start. I eat in my sleep, I hope that's not going to be a problem.
Hey, what's up, hello! I'm Bao Sprinkletruck. I enjoy long saunters across your countertop and grooming myself on your pillow. Me and Emma Watson don't talk anymore. Will you brush my tail? I like it brushed three times a day.
Shalom! My name is Boots Alltruck. I'm rambunctious, you're bashful, let's connect. Ever think it's weird that you never see Alexander the Great and Michael J Fox in the same place at the same time? Let's get matching George Costanza tattoos.

Behold, it is I, Old Grimskiboop. Some people think I look like Larry David, what do you think? Did we just become best friends?
Bonjour! I'm Koshka Muggoo, your littermate for life. I'm the biggest fan of Justin Bieber because I always put wasabi on my eggplant. Weird, right?
How goes it. Folks call me Azizi Delidrop. No one actually knows my real name, they just know how funky I am. I'm the biggest fan of Justin Timberlake because I always put stevia on my ice cream. My only policy is no politics.
Shalom, my name is Tocho Wasabiness, but I'll also respond to Gwen Stefani. My favourite way to vacation is watching Netflix and only consuming chocolate-covered pretzels. Don't even think about it.
Hey! Ho! Let's go. I'm Heffe Lionwidgey. I feel like I know you from a past life... Whenever I heard Mos Def it makes me think of macadamia nuts. I once curved a hobbit, it was glorious.
Hola! I'm Buttercup Sporkbobo, your littermate for life. I went to school with Gary the Snail, back then that was one lovable cat. I can't talk here, there are too many eavesdroppers around.

Heyo. I'm Fabiano Crazyniption. I beheld Michael Bolton when I was younger, but those days are gone. I like prank-calling celebrities at the lunar new year. Sometimes, when I'm grooming myself, I stop and think, isn't it crazy that the first person to walk on Mars will turn red.
Halloooo. My name is Hime Cartail, what's yours? I spend most nights trying to find out where Diane Keaton lives. I once tried to stalk Emma Watson. It did not end well for me.

Hello. I'm Gizmo Vilebum, student of Balthazaar of the Unknown Lands. I'm really trying to make it as a Mad Scientist. Spending my nights breaking into aquariums probably isn't helping, though. Will you take me skinnydipping? But first, can you tell me what that is?
*waves*, I'm Kottur Scootchwidgey, but what's in a name, anyway? Did you know Scream 3 is really about this lizard that gets covered in marmite? It's in the subtext. Will you brush my tail? I like it brushed three times a day.

Hey, what's up, hello. I'm Tzar Saucyfizzle, pleased to meet you. I spend all my money on Christina Aguilera records and I don't even have a record player yet. I love playing The Sims. Wanna join me?
*yawn* Sorry, you caught me napping. I excel at sculpting my guns. Oh, right, my name is Sensei Dillitime. I once interned for Chairman Mao. It was... interesting. Don't @ me.
Hi friend, my name is Peanut Linkzap, but I'll also respond to Ace of Base. I'm really trying to make it as a Fortune Teller. Spending my nights biting ankles probably isn't helping, though. Awkwaaaaaaaard.
Uh, hi. I'm Missy Purrwight. I'm petulant and profitable, and sometimes even bashful. I want our friendship to be like the one between Knives Chau and Ross Geller. Can you explain where babies come from? Asking for a friend...
Well look who it is, I'm Mister Dullbutt, but what's in a name, anyway? My best feature? My nostril, obviously. I also grow ghost peppers in my garden.
Allo. I'm Countess Sulkymuffin. Are you the one who embarassed me earlier? My parents fed me relish when I was a kid and I refuse to eat it now. I can't imagine being with any other breeder now that I've met you!
Heya. My name is Nick Sunnybuncle, and before you ask, no, it's not short for anything. To be honest, getting the people going is all I'm really interested in. Call my agent if you need me for anything outside of breeding.
Who goes there! I'm Allyouneed (born), but you already know that. I like to collect maxi dresses. If you're nice enough, maybe I'll give you one. Hurry, we haven't much time.
Sup. I am the one and only Colonel Twinklebaloo. At night, I like to put salmon paint all over my body and press up against buildings. I call it "making paint angels". Weird, right?
Yarr matey. I excel at fighting for the people. Oh, right, my name is Maow Gobzip. I'm thinking of writing a cookbook for different kinds of maple syrup. Does anyone even use Myspace anymore?
Mahalo. They call me Heffe Zippybuncle. Hey, got any flaming tacos on you? I'm always hungry. Pink Floyd wants me, but I'm more of a The Jonas Brothers fan. Let's go to my litter box, it's where I conduct all my meetings.
Bonjour. You can call me Krishna Scootchpookie. My best friends are a dolphin and a giraffe. I still dream of becoming a Time Traveller, but I'm not sure where to start. I heard Emma Watson has a crush on me. Meh.
Sup playa. I'm Katu Dawgtail. I beheld Lady Gaga when I was younger, but those days are gone. Some call me flammable, others call me adventurous, but really, the best description for me is cuddly. Talk to the paw.
Eyyyyyyy. I'm r1 pu29. No cat puns, please. Can you tell me if my fur pattern makes my toes look big? Let's braid our tails!
Ni hao! I'm Qattus Fancyrumpus. No cat puns, please. I'm convinced I'm the reincarnation of Genghis Khan but I hit my third eye when I was a kitten so who knows. Let's go shopping at the organic foods market on Sundays.
Why hello there. My name is Sensei Grogface. My favourite topic of conversation is King Henry VIII. If you look closely into my eyes, you'll see hints of my lineage as a oracle. I was voted "biggest teacher's pet", but I always thought I should have won "most likely to repeat high school".
Hiya. I respond to Precious Stoicwump, although that doesn't mean I'll acknowledge you. I'm trying to consume at least one serving of oatmeal every day. It's a newer health thing I read about on the web. You and I go together like cereal and relish.
Hello. My name is Jojo Squeebop. I pretty much only listen to Raekwon. I used to have a pet zombie. Its name was Ash Ketchum. Don't pull my tail. Unless I ask.
*yawn* Sorry, you caught me napping! I'm Briciola Proudbear. I am currently trying to start my own company making stockings for tripod kitties. I really want to skate a nice koala bear one day, is that weird? Let's go to my litter box, it's where I conduct all my meetings.
How you doin! I'm Tama Awesomekat. I'm hungry. Do you think King Louis XIV would've approved of my purrs and grooming style? I like to think so. Smell ya later!
Ni hao. I like inheriting millions because my name is Angel Sterntot. I did the album artwork for the latest Beck album. I'm pretty proud of it. Your secret is safe with me.
Boo! I'm Sparky Shybean, student of Balthazaar of the Unknown Lands. I combine the best qualities of Sandra Bullock, Joan of Arc, and Grimes. Goodnight, I'm going to sleep.
*挥挥手*. 大家都称我为 Pure PU15！我是一名私人金牌牙医，下班后我最喜欢蹿跳在树林间。 本喵就是喜欢在打扮时听 李宇春 的歌，你管我！ 本喵太期待与你共享 土耳其烤肉 了！
Sup. You may call me Tocho Poopknees. I shall call you Che Guevara. I once entered a litter-eating contest just to do standup comedy. I did not win. Let's go to my litter box, it's where I conduct all my meetings.
Oh, hello! I'm Tama Ministernano. I'm working on a scientific experiment involving the nose and the heart of a newly discovered type of shapeshifter. That's all I can tell you for now. I'm really trying to be more brilliant right now. Do you think it's working? Wanna hold hands?
Salutations. I'm Maow Stoicpoopsie, and I will do almost anything because someone dared me. I have made a mixtape for a duet with Tupac, but I'm having a hard time tracking them down. You can help, right? Come, I'll show you my collection of fish sauce.
*yawn* Sorry, you caught me napping. My parents named me President Softpop. I have no idea why. I used to love scratching my claws on carpet, until the accident. Gahhh, aren't you cute!
RAWR XD. I'm Lala Waltzluv, but you can call me whatever you'd like. I feel bad for those poor fools who don't believe snake people run the world. I once batted my paw at a liger, it was glorious.
Noice! I'm Marbles Yankeeki, but you can call me whatever you'd like. My best feature? My finger webbing, obviously. Can you explain where babies come from? Asking for a friend...
Boo. I'm Marshall Beautyfuzzle, and I will be your personal Firefighter. I feel bad for those poor fools who don't believe the moon landing was produced by Steven Spielberg. I like the way you smell.
先生女士们！! 我就是风云人物 Fabio Twinklewuv！喵星人我绝对是凯撒沙拉王国的下一个国王，因为别人看我总是一直在吃、吃、吃！ 本喵就是喜欢在打扮时听 披头四 的歌，你管我！ 我希望你也和我一样，吃 威士忌 的时候喜欢加点 东北辣酱 ！
Uh, hi. You may call me Sam Whipshmoops. I combine the strength of the t-rex with the grace of the hippopotamus. Fancy Cats are cool, but I'm more interested in breeding for love.
Hey! Ho! Let's go. I'm Tiger Sporksocks. Do you want to watch me counting sheep? I sure hope so. I'm totally obsessed with Milo. I'm reading your aura, and it's brown.
Ciao! I'm Misty Skookumthang, pleased to meet you. Can we PLEASE watch The Breakfast Club together? Sometimes, when I'm getting the people going, I stop and think, isn't it crazy that the upside down really does exist.
在干嘛？! 喵喵我叫  Lulu Cattydork！偷偷告诉你，我现在极度沉迷做直播，你说我该怎么办？ 当本喵没有在 做直播 时，我一定在 给明星打恶作剧电话！ 让我们一起培养更优秀的喵后代吧！
Hiya. Nick Tallcadabra is the name, riding the bus is the game. I listened to Mozart before it was cool. Let's watch Rick and Morty together.
Hark! I'm Koshka Tickpoopsie. I once interned for Teddy Roosevelt. It was... interesting. I want to know what love is. I want you to show me.
Hello human! I'm Arun Flirtytoes. What's your favourite hobby? Mine is personal development. I can't get enough of it. Did you know rappers write their own rhymes? I know, crazy right? I've been mistaken for Felix the Cat because I'm so good at volunteering at the local kitten rescue shelter. Shhhh, don't speak.
Yo yo yo! I'm called Mittens Fiddledeeroni. I like long walks on the beach and ketchup. I once got stung by a bee on my navel. Someday, all of this will be yours.
Oh hi. I'm Catsup Jankybum. I love to party with Rebecca Black, we get up to shenanigans together. I still dream of becoming a Taxidermist, but I'm not sure where to start. I can't talk here, there are too many eavesdroppers around.
Eyyyyyyy! I'm Pepper Spicybear, student of Balthazaar of the Unknown Lands. In my spare time I like to make yoga pants. À Bientôt!
Sup! The name's President Bilinano. I can whistle any Tom Jones song. It's a weird talent, but it entertains most people. I once tried to stalk Sandra Bullock. It did not end well for me.
RAWR XD. Call me Amiga Hornsocks. Don't call me Sal. I once saw a fortune teller and they told me Pluto is actually a planet. Let's go invest in a condo together.
Hello human. My name is Ruwa Slippyshorts. Let's get to know each other better. I'm convinced I'm the reincarnation of Picasso but I hit my noggin when I was a kitten so who knows. À Bientôt!
Ohayo. My name is Demon Stoicniption. My favourite topic of conversation is Jane Austen. I try to live my life the way I think Pauly D would. Holla at me.
Top o' the muffin to ya. My parents named me Priya Greyhickey, but I prefer Confucius. My best dress-up costume ever was when I impersonated Rick Sanchez. This concludes our business dealings.
